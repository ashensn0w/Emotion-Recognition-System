"""Sorry.""",sadness
"""It’s just a joke.""",joy
"""It's nice to see you again, Rainie.""",joy
"""But I am not someone you can follow carelessly,"" he said with a serious tone and I can feel the goosebumps all over my body. The first thing that came into my mind is to escape but I don't want to be seen as a coward. Not by him.",fear
"I can see a huge, barren field, with crows, ravens and vultures flying around it. The sky was red because of the setting sun and it heightened the eerie scenery. I can also hear voices, some of them are angry and the others are wailing their hearts out. Standing in the middle of the field was an old man holding his weapon—a bardiche.",fear
"""Hey."" I stepped forward and slapped him hard. ""Call me anything but stupid because I am not."" After getting my fan from my side, I pointed it at him. ""Remember that and I hope it won't fade away from your memories.""",anger
"We both went quiet after that. I don't know what happened but after a few seconds, we smiled at each other. And this time, I know that something has changed between us.",joy
"""Thanks, Naomi,"" he said. ""I owe you one.""",joy

"""So you heard it, huh?"" he calmly said and his tone was bone-chilling.",fear
"""Thank you,"" I said and he smiled in return.",joy
"I can't remember anything from my parents but my mother's favorite line: A person's memories can be seen clearly through his eyes. She's right, because right now, Mitsuo's memories flooded my own mind. A sea of blood, hundreds of corpses, people's cry all over the place, and him in the middle of all of that. Using all of my remaining mental strength, I shifted my gaze from his eyes to his wound, and I fell on my knees, panting heavily.",sadness
"""Yes and it's creepy.""",fear
"""Okay lang ako! Ano ba kayo?""",anger
"""Nasira ang iyong tibialis anterior.""",fear
"""Ha? Saan 'yun? Ay basta, ayos lang ako. Habulin na lang natin 'yung kriminal at baka makatakas siya!""",anger
"""Nakakalungkot, nasa Kanluran siya.""",sadness
"""Tsk. Kailangan kong magtago. Alam na ng mga pulis na ako ang pumatay sa hayup na 'yun,"" sabi nung kriminal.",fear
"""Hmm, 115 bpm. Tiyak na sabik,"" sabay ngiti niya sa akin.",joy
"""Pfft. Nakakatawa 'yung reaksyon mo kanina!""",joy
"""Pano nakakatakot 'yang itsura mo. Masyadong seryoso.""",fear
"""Hoy Ken!"" sabay batok niya kay Ken.",anger
"""Aray! Problema mo?! Sakit nun ha! Ginulo mo pa buhok ko!""",anger
"Pagkatapos naming magpakilala ay wala nang nagsalita at naramdaman ko na naman ang tensyon sa pagitan naming lahat.",fear
"Kahit na sibil kami sa isa't isa ngayon ay may pagdududa pa rin kami sa kahihinatnan ng pulong na ito.",fear
"Bigla namang tumingin si Nel kay Krystal at alam kong anumang oras ay may mangyayari nang masama dahil bigla ulit tumaas ang tensyon sa paligid.",fear
"""May ibig ka bang ipahiwatig?"" maangas na sabi ni Krystal . . . at literal ang ibig kong sabihin dahil sa namumuong yelo sa lamesa kung saan nakalapag ang kamay niya.",anger
"Uh oh. Naamoy ko ang gulo.",fear
"""Whoa . . . paanong . . . "" Hindi na naituloy ni Akane ang sasabihin niya at napanganga na lang din siya.",joy
"""Oh. Magandang lugar. Hindi ko akalaing may umiiral na ganito.""",joy
"At kahit walang magsabi ay alam kong may tensyon na namamagitan sa aming lahat.",fear
"Tumingin siya sa akin tapos ngumiti kaya napangiti rin ako.",joy
"""Masaya akong makita ka ulit, Rainie.""",joy
"Whoa . . . paanong . . .  Hindi na naituloy ni Akane ang sasabihin niya at napanganga na lang din siya.",joy
"Oh. Magandang lugar. Hindi ko akalaing may umiiral na ganito.",joy
"At kahit walang magsabi ay alam kong may tensyon na namamagitan sa aming lahat.",fear
"Tumingin siya sa akin tapos ngumiti kaya napangiti rin ako.",joy
"Masaya akong makita ka ulit, Rainie.",joy
"""It's just that . . . I don't want the both of you to be labeled as an Executioner's wife and child. But I'll do anything to protect you so you don't need to worry. I made this choice so I will do anything to keep you out of danger.""",sadness
"Suddenly, I imagined the three of us walking together, our child in his arms while I look at them happily. It made me satisfied.",joy
"Yes, for he is the greatest gift you have given me, and a reminder that he should protect you when I'm not around.",joy
"""I hope we could attend this festival next year together with Nathan,"" I said and he just smiled.",joy
"""Me too."" A smile was formed on my lips, ""maybe she wants a younger brother and I think she's really good at taking care of others.""",joy
"I stayed alert after she said that since our last encounter didn't go well.",fear
"I'm scared.",fear
"""Oh God. You're really here, Akemi.""",joy
"""Rainie,"" she said with a smile. ""How about your son?""",joy
"Naomi, please. I need to see him. I want to see him. Please.",sadness
"""But I can say that you deserve to die because you said those things. Talk bad about her and you'll die by my hands.""",anger
"""Idiot. Don't say that.""",anger
"""Naomi, you don't have to do this,""Akemi said. ""You have your own family to protect, so please . .""",sadness
"""Don't touch them!"" I yelled.",anger
"Nel sped up and both of them cursed as they cried for their lives.",fear
"I could still see the scars on her arms and I remembered how she almost died during the fight against the Navis.",sadness
"She lost her mother for the second time and now she would lose Dale, too",sadness
"""I'm curious about your previous life,"" she said. ""You know, we've been teammates for so long yet I only know a few things about you.""",sadness
"""My life's not that interesting,"" I retorted.",sadness
"My childhood in Shima was kept a secret and I was grateful that the Commander didn't break his word.",joy
"My parents were still considered traitors and I'm sure people wouldn't see me any different if they learned about them.",sadness
"In times like this, I missed him to the point that it felt like I was back to being a child again.",sadness
"When I traveled here few weeks ago, I felt alone and restless, not knowing how long I would drift in the middle of nowhere.",sadness
"But this time, it was kind of calming knowing I had my comrades with me. They wouldn't be probably allowed to enter the island but knowing that the three of them would be mwaiting for me outside was already reassuring enough.",joy
"I smiled at them and stole a snack from Jett's supplies.",joy
"""Mentally draining, isn't it?"" I said while inspecting my sword.",sadness
"""I can't even imagine how I'm going to survive if I'm alone. How do you even do it?""",sadness
"The temperature suddenly dropped and the sky turned gray. A swirl of mist and thick fog enveloped our surroundings, obscuring our vision. Each of them assumed a defensive stance, their weapons ready.",fear
"I stood at the front of the raft. ""We're here."" As soon as I said those words, a smaller raft appeared and got wafted to our direction. I turned to them and smiled.",joy
"""Sorry. I'm the only one who can go inside.""",sadness
"""Until I return. Don't do anything. Don't look for me. Just stay here and wait.""",anger
"I stared at Jett and smirked. ""You'd be dead before you can do anything.""",anger

"""Why are you here again?"" asked Farallon who seemed displeased with my presence.",anger
"""I have a delivery,"" I retorted. ""Kind of grand prize material."" That made him relax for a bit",joy
"I chuckled. ""Jealous?""",joy
"""Shut your mouth,"" Naia.",anger
"""Why are you here, kid?"" he asked in a disgruntled tone",anger
"I had to choke back the creeping fear on my throat.",fear
"Nag-impok ng galit ang Nox laban sa mga humdrum at nilapastangan ang kanilang pag-iral.",anger

"Matapos ang kanyang talumpati, ipinabatid niya sa kanila na kasalukuyang nagpapahinga ang mga Executive dahil sa mga sugat na natamo nila.",sadness
"Nagbigay din siya ng mga bagong misyon sa mga naroroong team at sinabing magtitiwala siya sa kanila.",joy
"Sa unang pagkakataon sa mahabang panahon, pinahinga ko ang aking isipan matapos magtayo ng mga pader upang protektahan ang aking mga iniisip.",joy
"""Bakit hindi siya pwedeng maging isang normal na lider?"" reklamo niya.",anger

"""Sa tingin ko, alam mo na kung bakit ka nandito,"" sabi niya.",anger
"Dahil sa mga nangyari bago ang pagkuha kay Dale at Zeno, may ideya na ako tungkol sa gusto niyang gawin ko. Tumigas ang ekspresyon ko.",anger
"""Opo, Sir,"" sagot ko.",sadness
"Pakiramdam ko ay gumagapang ang mga kiliti sa aking balat at kailangan kong pigilan ang sarili ko sa pag-ngatog. Mas masidhing nakakatakot ang nakakapanik na aura kaysa sa huling pagkakataon.",fear
"""Bakit ka nandito ulit?"" tanong ni Farallon na tila hindi natutuwa sa aking presensya.",anger
"""May dala ako,"" sagot ko. ""Parang materyales para sa grand prize."" Dahil doon, kumalma siya ng kaunti.",joy
"Tumawa ako. ""Naiinggit ka ba?""",joy
"""Tumahimik ka,"" Naia.",anger
"""Bakit ka nandito, bata?"" tanong niya sa isang inis na tono.",anger
"Kinailangan kong pigilan ang unti-unting takot na umaakyat sa aking lalamunan.",fear
"Well, gusto niyang tapusin ang problemang Nox nang mabilis hangga't maaari.""",anger
