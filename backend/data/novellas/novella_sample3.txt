One sunny afternoon, a little girl named Mia was playing outside her house. She loved spending time in her backyard, especially with her fluffy white kitten, Snowy. But when she looked around, she realized that Snowy was nowhere to be found.

"Mama! Have you seen Snowy?" Mia shouted, her voice filled with worry.

"No, dear. Why don't you check the garden?" her mother replied.

Mia rushed to the garden and called out, "Snowy! Where are you?" She searched behind the flowers and under the bushes, but there was still no sign of her kitten.

Just then, Mia heard a soft meowing sound coming from the tall grass. She quickly ran over and found Snowy stuck between the blades of grass. "Oh, Snowy! I was so worried about you!" she exclaimed, picking up her kitten.

From that day on, Mia made sure to keep a closer eye on Snowy, and they became the best of friends, always playing together in the sun.
