"""Your tibialis anterior is damaged.""",fear
"""Sadly, he's in the West.""",sadness
"""Sorry.""",sadness
"""It’s just a joke.""",joy
"""It's nice to see you again, Rainie.""",joy
Uh oh. I smell trouble.,fear
"Then all of a sudden, I sensed an incredible amount of pressure and all of us summoned and drew our weapons, pointing them to each other, then the table and chairs were suddenly frozen.",fear
"""No. You sound like your dad—a leader.""",joy
"That place is too quiet that I tend to hear a lot of buzzing and humming, plus the tension in the surrounding is too high.",fear
"""Of course. Her team successfully infiltrated the Shinigami's base and retrieved her comrades' eyes.""",joy
"""That's great.""",joy
"""I see. I guess there's no need to worry about you.""",joy
"""Thanks for this, by the way. It warms me up since we're living on a cold place.""",joy
"""Nice. I didn't even notice it,"" then he tossed it to Reiji and he caught it.",joy
"""That it's dangerous. She's worried about us.""",fear
"""Don't let go,"" Hiro said. And the next thing I knew, the Black Dimension was already closing and I saw the pain in his expression.",fear
"""You almost died.""",fear
"She lost her husband and dearest friends, and she didn't see her son for fifteen years.",sadness
"""What did you do? Two of your fatal points are in dire state.""",fear
"""N-no way. My eyes are not that...""",fear
They are in trouble.,fear
I can hear the two of them cursing inside their head while heading to the building in front of them.,anger
I smiled triumphantly. I fulfilled my role.,joy
But I don't think I can last any longer because all of them lunged at me.,sadness
These Shinigamis are going to kill me.,fear
"""What the hell is this creepy feeling?""",fear
"""One more word and I'll behead you.""",anger
"""If you could, old hag.""",anger
"""You're going with us, whether you like it or not.""",anger
I have a bad feeling about this.,fear
"""Go all out. Erase this place where she suffered a lot.""",anger
"""Chase him!""",anger
"""I won't let you touch him,"" I whispered as I released the arrow from the bow.",anger
It hit the back of the Shinigami and Darwin looked at me with a proud expression.,joy
"As I was looking at my father taking down the building, I felt a sense of relief and sadness. Seeing his actions, I know that he wanted to do this after all this time. He wanted to erase this place where my mother suffered.",sadness
"""Yeah. I'm scared to know the truth.""",fear
"""I really admire you, Mama. You're so strong. And even if nobody's talking about you here because they said you were a curse, you will always be my hero. It's just sad that you're not here anymore.""",sadness
"""She died in his arms.""",sadness
"""I don't know,"" he said and I saw the sadness in his eyes. ""These past few months, I've been recollecting some unfamiliar memories.""",sadness
"""But remembering is just as worse as forgetting.""",sadness
"""His cries filled the place.""",sadness
"""Still unstable but we're recovering. Thanks to all of you.""",joy
"""Wow. Thank you, Darwin. I'm going to use this.""",joy
I'm glad that it didn't turn out that way. I still have him at my side.,joy
"""I'm back, Vince,"" I whispered as I caressed his grave.",sadness
His death still haunts me and gives me nightmares.,sadness
"""Even though a lot of things happened, I'm glad that I still have the both of you,"" I said while keeping my tears from falling. ""So please...don't you ever dare to die on me, too.""",sadness
Coming back here and being with them made those memories vivid. If I could only rewind the time we were the happiest... If I could only stop the time once again...,sadness
"However, after hearing his thoughts, I felt sad and hurt because he's starting to remember the war fifteen years ago when he was just a one-year old baby. Maybe subconsciously, he pushed them away to the depths of his mind but the second war triggered them to resurface.",sadness
"""He chose to protect you. He did everything to save our future so instead of being sorry, be thankful to your father. Will you do that for me, Nathan?""",sadness
My tears fell as I remember our happy moments together and I feel miserable because all these memories keep coming back...but he never does. And he never will.,sadness
"""Tss. I want to get out of this place immediately. Why do I have to be with these people? I'm going to kick that old fart's ass when I get back.""",anger
"""N-No, sir.""",fear
"""Damn you, old fart, are you playing with me?!""",anger
"""Well, being curious isn't bad.""",joy
Wow. That's handy but a bit sad. Will he also forget people after a long time? Will his memories fade away?,sadness
"""You look so confident and calculating outside but deep inside, you're anxious and insecure of yourself.""",sadness
"""Sir Eiichi!"" I squeaked and he just smiled at me.",joy
"Beyond that, wild and vicious creatures freely roam around to serve as our external protection from unwelcomed visitors. However, we are not exempted from their attacks.",fear
"Without any warning, something monstrous charged towards me.",fear
I immediately jumped to the branches of the tree beside me and the creature banged its head straight to the bark. The tree shook tremendously and I almost fell directly to that thing.,fear
"His low growl made my skin crawl and when the moonlight illuminated the surroundings, my stomach tightened due to the creature's unsightly appearance.",fear
"Possessing a broad and long husk, it looks like a boar but the size of lion. Its jaws and teeth are those of a shark while its body is covered with sharp hairs. Looking at it for a few seconds made me nauseous and panic started to engulf my senses.",fear
"Just when I thought that one monster is enough to scare the heck out of me, two . . . three . . . six . . . six more appeared and surrounded us. Terror dominated my mind and body.",fear
"""Shit, I said stop it!"" Mitsuo shouted and he kneeled so that I can see him. ""These creatures can smell fear and they are attracted to it. If you don't want to attract more of them, calm yourself!""",anger
"""Let me hold this for a while,"" I breathed. ""Please."" He stayed silent but after a few seconds, he moved and positioned his back in front of me.",fear
"""Him?"" A taunting smile formed on her lips.",joy
Hearing the Council of Elders made my skin crawl. They are a group of advisers and counselors who help the leaders with their decisions and rules.,fear
Their loyalty to the tribe is absolute but that's also the reason why they are perceived as cold and heartless.,fear
"They will do anything to protect the Senshins and this place, even if it poses harm and danger to others.",fear
"""But I am not someone you can follow carelessly,"" he said with a serious tone and I can feel the goosebumps all over my body. The first thing that came into my mind is to escape but I don't want to be seen as a coward. Not by him.",fear
"I can see a huge, barren field, with crows, ravens and vultures flying around it. The sky was red because of the setting sun and it heightened the eerie scenery. I can also hear voices, some of them are angry and the others are wailing their hearts out. Standing in the middle of the field was an old man holding his weapon—a bardiche.",fear
"""Hey."" I stepped forward and slapped him hard. ""Call me anything but stupid because I am not."" After getting my fan from my side, I pointed it at him. ""Remember that and I hope it won't fade away from your memories.""",anger
"We both went quiet after that. I don't know what happened but after a few seconds, we smiled at each other. And this time, I know that something has changed between us.",joy
"""Thanks, Naomi,"" he said. ""I owe you one.""",joy
"""He's annoying. Calling me stupid and funny. Who is he anyway? Damn him.""",anger
"Even though she teased me nonstop a while ago, I smiled when I see her peaceful expression. Meeting with Koharu after a long time must have made her really happy.",joy
I was already on page 13 when I read that part and I was amazed because those chemicals can induce the emotion called love. The science part is interesting but I'm more excited to read the psychological interpretation of it.,joy
"""Love is dangerous, and is just next door to death.""",fear
"""Maybe coming here is a wrong decision after all. Damn it, old fart. This is all your fault.""",anger
"""So you heard it, huh?"" he calmly said and his tone was bone-chilling.",fear
"""Thank you,"" I said and he smiled in return.",joy
"I can't remember anything from my parents but my mother's favorite line: A person's memories can be seen clearly through his eyes. She's right, because right now, Mitsuo's memories flooded my own mind. A sea of blood, hundreds of corpses, people's cry all over the place, and him in the middle of all of that. Using all of my remaining mental strength, I shifted my gaze from his eyes to his wound, and I fell on my knees, panting heavily.",sadness
"""Yes and it's creepy.""",fear
"""You should learn from the expert,"" I said with confidence.",joy
"""So our theory is really true,"" I said, amazed by the words written on the books.",joy
We simultaneously called their names because their presence are too overwhelming to the point that it's already suffocating.,fear
"""Oohh. It has been a long time since you've been this distracted,"" Akira suddenly said and she looked at me with a taunting smile.",joy
"After reading that entry, Akemi and Mitsuo, with their menacing faces, appeared in my mind and I immediately shuddered. The thought of them being Shinigamis was too frightening and disturbing.",fear
"""It's better if you do not know,"" he said and his contemptuous smile frustrated me.",anger
"I was dead serious about that but he stared at me, as if I just said something ridiculous, and after a few seconds, he burst out laughing.",joy
Is this his concept of closure? I don't even know what he meant by this. I don't understand him and I don't like the feeling of being confused.,sadness
"""Forget about me,"" he said and I felt a twinge in my chest.",sadness
"""Please don't."" After hearing that, I felt hurt. For the first time, I was broken.",sadness
"I like him, I had admitted that, but I don't think it was right. Yes, he's a great and gentle person despite of his appearance and action but his memories . . . those thoughts that I have seen showed otherwise.",fear
"His glaring eyes, cunning smile, his clothes soaked in people's blood and the sword he was holding . . . his memories made me shudder in fear.",fear
I was thinking of a plan to subdue him but I immediately froze when I saw the body lying behind him. The guy's throat was slashed and his blood painted the park's cobblestones.,fear
"The murderer turned around and locked eyes with me. When I saw his scarred face, I almost stopped breathing.",fear
"I was paralyzed with fear and confusion but his raging, intense, green eyes showed no sympathy.",fear
"""Run away! Now! He's going to kill everyone!"" With much fear in my voice, and I wasn't faking it, my warning was effective. All of them scrambled away from the scene and after a few seconds, the guy, the dead body and me were the only ones left.",fear
