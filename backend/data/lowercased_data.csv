"this article made a great deal of noise, and, being copied into all the papers, seriously depressed the advocates of the rash tourist.",fear
"everybody knows that england is the world of betting men, who are of a higher class than mere gamblers; to bet is in the english temperament.",fear
"not only the members of the reform, but the general public, made heavy wagers for or against phileas fogg.",fear
"""phileas fogg bonds"" were offered at par or at a premium, and a great business was done in them.",fear
"lord albemarle, an elderly paralytic gentleman, was now the only advocate of phileas fogg left.",fear
"when the folly as well as the uselessness of the adventure was pointed out to him, he contented himself with replying, ""if the thing is feasible, the first to do it ought to be an englishman.""",fear
"the fogg party dwindled more and more, everybody was going against him, and the bets stood a hundred and fifty and two hundred to one.",fear
the effect of this dispatch was instantaneous.,fear
the polished gentleman disappeared to give place to the bank robber.,fear
"his photograph, which was hung with those of the rest of the members at the reform club, was minutely examined.",fear
"the mysterious habits of phileas fogg were recalled; his solitary ways, his sudden departure.",fear
"it seemed clear that, in undertaking a tour round the world on the pretext of a wager, he had had no other end in view than to elude the detectives, and throw them off his track.",fear
"i shall die. i shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched.",sadness
"polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can i find rest but in death?",sadness
"i shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must i find my happiness.",sadness
"blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever",sadness
"i thank you, walton, for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone?",sadness
"can any man be to me as clerval was, or any woman another elizabeth?",sadness
"even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain.",sadness
"when i die, i am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory.",sadness
but now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal.,sadness
"no guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine.",sadness
my tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment.,sadness
but it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil.,sadness
that is also my victim! in his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close!,sadness
"alas! he is cold, he cannot answer me.",sadness
must i then lose this admirable being? i have longed for a friend; i have sought one who would sympathise with and love me,sadness
"all my speculations and hopes are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, i am chained in an eternal hell",sadness
soon these burning miseries will be extinct,sadness
"what agonising fondness did i feel for them! how did i cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that they still lived!",sadness
"at such moments vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and i pursued my path towards the destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul.",sadness
"he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.",sadness
"farewell! i leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold. farewell, frankenstein!",sadness
"but soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “i shall die, and what i now feel be no longer felt. soon these burning miseries will be extinct.",sadness
the only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death.,sadness
he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance.,sadness
"oh! my friend, if you had known me as i once was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation.",sadness
"i was left desolate. my own strength is exhausted, and i must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration.",sadness
"despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until i fell, never, never again to rise.",sadness
"my father and ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that i bore.",sadness
"his eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight—his elizabeth, his more than daughter.",sadness
"what then became of me? i know not; i lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.",sadness
"sometimes, indeed, i dreamt that i wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth, but i awoke and found myself in a dungeon.",sadness
"when actuated by selfish and vicious motives, i asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and i renew this request now, when i am only induced by reason and virtue.",sadness
"the forms of the beloved dead flit before me, and i hasten to their arms.",sadness
"his voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his effort, he sank into silence.",sadness
"about half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips.",sadness
"margaret, what comment can i make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit?",sadness
what can i say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow? all that i should express would be inadequate and feeble.,sadness
"but the overflowing misery i now felt, and the excess of agitation that i endured rendered me incapable of any exertion.",sadness
"i threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose.",sadness
"if i looked up, i saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which i had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.",sadness
tears streamed from my eyes.,sadness
nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.,sadness
"mine has been a tale of horrors; i have reached their acme, and what i must now relate can but be tedious to you",sadness
"i see him now, excellent and venerable old man! his eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight.",sadness
he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him.,sadness
"sometimes, indeed, i dreamt that i wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth, but i awoke and found myself in a dungeon.",sadness
my present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost. i was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion.,sadness
i have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. how i have lived i hardly know; many times have i stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death.,sadness
"when i quitted geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which i might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. but my plan was unsettled, and i wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain what path i should pursue",sadness
"the spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner.",sadness
"oh! peace, peace, my love,"" replied i; ""this night, and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.",sadness
great god! why did i not then expire! why am i here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth?,sadness
"oh, frankenstein! generous and self-devoted being! what does it avail that i now ask thee to pardon me? i, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst. alas!",sadness
"this suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event; tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder i am now to lament?",sadness
"oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, i now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly.",sadness
towards morning i was possessed by a kind of nightmare; i felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears.,sadness
"i abhorred the face of man. oh, not abhorred! they were my brethren, my fellow beings, and i felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism.",sadness
"how they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!",sadness
my father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair,sadness
"sometimes he thought that i felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.",sadness
"justine, poor unhappy justine, was as innocent as i, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and i am the cause of this—i murdered her.",sadness
"william, justine, and henry—they all died by my hands.",sadness
"my father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when i thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium.",sadness
i avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch i had created.,sadness
"i had a persuasion that i should be supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue.",sadness
"but, besides, i could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast.",sadness
"i checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when i would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.",sadness
"company was irksome to me; when alone, i could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of henry soothed me, and i could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace",sadness
"but busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to my heart.",sadness
"i saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of william and justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.",sadness
he was also pursuing an object he had long had in view.,sadness
"my father’s care and attentions were indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill",sadness
"my strength was gone. i was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame",sadness
"still, as i urged our leaving ireland with such inquietude and impatience, my father thought it best to yield.",sadness
"i hailed the darkness that shut ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when i reflected that i should soon see geneva.",sadness
"the past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which i was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that i was deceived by no vision and that clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation.",sadness
"i repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing with my family in geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for ingolstadt.""",sadness
"i remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy, and i called to mind the night in which he first lived.",sadness
"i was unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and i wept bitterly.",sadness
but sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me.,sadness
"my father, who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible.",sadness
"we landed, and proceeded to paris. i soon found that i had overtaxed my strength and that i must repose before i could continue my journey.",sadness
but i felt that i had no right to share their intercourse. i had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans.,sadness
"alas! my father, how little do you know me. human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as i felt pride.",sadness
"i looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which i dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom.",sadness
"i sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from the sea; i had not sufficient light for my employment, and i remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether i should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it.",sadness
"as i sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what i was now doing.",sadness
"i was now about to form another being of whose dispositions i was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness.",sadness
"had i right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?",sadness
"i had before been moved by the sophisms of the being i had created; i had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me.",sadness
"i shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.",sadness
"i trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, i saw by the light of the moon the dæmon at the casement.",sadness
"he was for ever busy, and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind.",sadness
"i tried to conceal this as much as possible, that i might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection.",sadness
"i often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that i might remain alone.",sadness
"i now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head.",sadness
"every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that i spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.",sadness
"he mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as perth, where he resided.",sadness
"clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and i, although i abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.",sadness
"my strength was gone. i was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame.",sadness
it was midnight. i lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves.,sadness
"my father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy.",sadness
"every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine.",sadness
i took refuge in the most perfect solitude,sadness
"i passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless.",sadness
but the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure.,sadness
i listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply.,sadness
"why, in that instant, did i not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed?",sadness
i could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery.,sadness
the cold stars shone in mockery.,sadness
"finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin.",sadness
but this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; i became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair.,sadness
there was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me.,sadness
"i declared everlasting war against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.",sadness
my fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams.,sadness
i awoke exhausted.,sadness
"i crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in search of food.",sadness
you may render me the most miserable of men.,sadness
i am malicious because i am miserable.,sadness
am i not shunned and hated by all mankind?,sadness
i now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.,sadness
"our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery i now feel.",sadness
"as soon as i was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation, i quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.",sadness
"i resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible.",sadness
"unfeeling, heartless creator! you had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.",sadness
from you i determined to seek that justice which i vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form.,sadness
nature decayed around me.,sadness
the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me.,sadness
"mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and i found no shelter.",sadness
"the mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness.",sadness
a circumstance that happened when i arrived on the confines of switzerland confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.,sadness
a few incidents now and then directed me.,sadness
the agony of my feelings allowed me no respite.,sadness
i travelled only when i was secured by night from the view of man.,sadness
the feelings of kindness and gentleness which i had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.,sadness
"the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and i fainted.",sadness
"for some weeks i led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound which i had received.",sadness
my sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction.,sadness
my travels were long and the sufferings i endured intense.,sadness
"i did not know the names of the towns that i was to pass through, nor could i ask information from a single human being.",sadness
"the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare.",sadness
the mildness of my nature had fled.,sadness
"nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear.",sadness
"justine died, she rested, and i was alive. the blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove",sadness
"sleep fled from my eyes; i wandered like an evil spirit, for i had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more (i persuaded myself) was yet behind.",sadness
"now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, i was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe.",sadness
"i shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.",sadness
"""my father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits.",sadness
no one could love a child more than i loved your brother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke...,sadness
"...if remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my other sensations. now i could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.",sadness
"i often, i say, was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever.",sadness
"i had been the author of unalterable evils, and i lived in daily fear lest the monster whom i had created should perpetrate some new wickedness.",sadness
at these moments i wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that i might afford them consolation and happiness. but that could not be. remorse extinguished every hope.,sadness
our house was the house of mourning.,sadness
elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed.,sadness
she was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects.,sadness
"when i reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of justine moritz, i no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me.",sadness
"before, i looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that i read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood.",sadness
"alas! victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness?",sadness
"william and justine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected.",sadness
"but even if i were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, i would not change places with such a wretch.",sadness
i listened to this discourse with the extremest agony.,sadness
"i, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer.",sadness
"...there is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me tremble.",sadness
"dear victor, banish these dark passions.",sadness
"...nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were ineffectual.",sadness
i was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate.,sadness
"but i was restrained, when i thought of the heroic and suffering elizabeth, whom i tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine.",sadness
i thought also of my father and surviving brother; should i by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom i had let loose among them?,sadness
my abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived.,sadness
"all of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought.",sadness
we rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.,sadness
we rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.,sadness
"we feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep, embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away; it is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow, the path of its departure still is free.",sadness
"uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself.",sadness
"it was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before.",sadness
"he played a sweet mournful air which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet.",sadness
"imagine, my friend, that you are a creature capable of sensation and reason, and yet you are confined to this miserable existence; you hear a sound which you believe to be the result of close pursuit.",sadness
"i had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.",sadness
"you quit your place of concealment and seek that opportunity of flight which would ensure your safety, and have your vigilance rewarded by seeing the detested object of your solicitude a few paces from you.",sadness
for this i had deprived myself of rest and health.,sadness
"i had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that i had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.",sadness
"unable to endure the aspect of the being i had created, i rushed out of the room.",sadness
"my heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and i hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me.",sadness
"i did not dare return to the apartment which i inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky.",sadness
"i continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind.",sadness
"i traversed the streets, without any clear conception of where i was or what i was doing.",sadness
"my heart was full of grief, and my eyes swam with the remembrance of her wrongs.",sadness
"to hear the opinions of men whose judgments may not be biased and whose feelings are not likely to be worked upon, is one of the first duties of a man who holds such a situation as mine.",sadness
"when she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh.",sadness
"we have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved william!",sadness
"come, dearest victor; you alone can console elizabeth. she weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart.",sadness
"your dear mother! alas, victor! i now say, thank god she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!",sadness
"clerval, who had watched my countenance as i read this letter, was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy i at first expressed on receiving news from my friends.",sadness
"""i threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.",sadness
"my dear frankenstein,” exclaimed henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy?",sadness
"tears also gushed from the eyes of clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.",sadness
"""poor william!” said he, “dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother!",sadness
"who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss!",sadness
to die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! how much more a murderer that could destroy radiant innocence!,sadness
"poor little fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest.",sadness
"the pang is over, his sufferings are at an end forever.",sadness
"i hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.",sadness
my journey was very melancholy.,sadness
i could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind.,sadness
i wept like a child.,sadness
"is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?",sadness
"it removes more than half my misfortune, and i feel as if i could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.",sadness
"but i, the true murderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation.",sadness
anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; i bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish.,sadness
"we stayed several hours with justine, and it was with great difficulty that elizabeth could tear herself away.",sadness
"""i wish,” cried she, “that i were to die with you; i cannot live in this world of misery.",sadness
"justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears.",sadness
"she embraced elizabeth and said in a voice of half-suppressed emotion, 'farewell, sweet lady, dearest elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer!",sadness
elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer.,sadness
my passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them.,sadness
"and when i received their cold answers and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal died away on my lips.",sadness
"thus i might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim.",sadness
"from the tortures of my own heart, i turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my elizabeth.",sadness
"and my father’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home—all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands!",sadness
"ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears!",sadness
"again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!",sadness
"frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears.",sadness
"happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave has succeeded to your sad torments!",sadness
"thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, i beheld those i loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of william and justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.",sadness
"""no, justine,” said elizabeth; “he is more convinced of your innocence than i was, for even when he heard that you had confessed, he did not credit it.",sadness
"during this conversation i had retired to a corner of the prison room, where i could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.",sadness
"the poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as i did, such deep and bitter agony.",sadness
"when she saw who it was, she approached me and said, 'dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, i hope, do not believe that i am guilty?",sadness
"elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.",sadness
"william is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! victor, he is murdered!",sadness

"""there was no study, nor were there books, which would have been quite useless to mr. fogg; for at the reform two libraries, one of general literature and the other of law and politics, were at his service.""",joy
"""a moderate-sized safe stood in his bedroom, constructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars; but passepartout found neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere; everything betrayed the most tranquil and peaceable habits.""",joy
