"I can't remember anything from my parents but my mother's favorite line: A person's memories can be seen clearly through his eyes. She's right, because right now, Mitsuo's memories flooded my own mind. A sea of blood, hundreds of corpses, people's cry all over the place, and him in the middle of all of that.

"""Oohh. It has been a long time since you've been this distracted,"" Akira suddenly said and she looked at me with a taunting smile.",joy
"After reading that entry, Akemi and Mitsuo, with their menacing faces, appeared in my mind and I immediately shuddered. The thought of them being Shinigamis was too frightening and disturbing.",fear
"""It's better if you do not know,"" he said and his contemptuous smile frustrated me.",anger
"I was dead serious about that but he stared at me, as if I just said something ridiculous, and after a few seconds, he burst out laughing.",joy
Is this his concept of closure? I don't even know what he meant by this. I don't understand him and I don't like the feeling of being confused.,sadness
"""Forget about me,"" he said and I felt a twinge in my chest.",sadness
"""Please don't."" After hearing that, I felt hurt. For the first time, I was broken.",sadness
"I like him, I had admitted that, but I don't think it was right. Yes, he's a great and gentle person despite of his appearance and action but his memories . . . those thoughts that I have seen showed otherwise.",fear
"His glaring eyes, cunning smile, his clothes soaked in people's blood and the sword he was holding . . . his memories made me shudder in fear.",fear
I was thinking of a plan to subdue him but I immediately froze when I saw the body lying behind him. The guy's throat was slashed and his blood painted the park's cobblestones.,fear
"The murderer turned around and locked eyes with me. When I saw his scarred face, I almost stopped breathing.",fear
"I was paralyzed with fear and confusion but his raging, intense, green eyes showed no sympathy.",fear
"""Run away! Now! He's going to kill everyone!"" With much fear in my voice, and I wasn't faking it, my warning was effective. All of them scrambled away from the scene and after a few seconds, the guy, the dead body and me were the only ones left.",fear
"""You . . ."" He pointed at me again. ""You're like me! You can't deceive me!"" He roared with laughter that made my skin crawl but it was short-lived.",fear
He looked like a mad man and I was beyond scared. I reached for my fan but I went rigid when he hollered at me.,fear
"""You're the same as them!"" he roared and held the knife with both of his hands, aiming at my chest. ""You want to kill me! Die! Die!""",anger
"He turned around and when our eyes met, my body convulsed, as if the fear and panic I should've felt earlier took effect just now. He knelt in front of me and gently pulled me in for a hug.",fear
"I didn't know why but tears started falling from my eyes. I slapped his back because I was frustrated, confused and scared at the same time but he didn't complain. Instead, he pulled me closer.",sadness
"""And this is why I don't want you to get close to me,"" he breathed and I felt the thumping of his heart against his chest.",sadness
"""But I'm glad you're safe. I'm really glad and thankful.""",joy
"""Liar,"" I said between my sobs.",sadness
"Our conversation was suddenly cut off by loud thud and Akira's scream. When I turned around, Akemi was already laying unconscious on the floor.",fear
"Thank you, but I shouldn't be loved. I might hurt and break you so give your heart to someone who could really protect you. But your feelings toward me, I'll treasure it.",sadness
"Even though my senses were dwindling, I felt the tears running down my cheeks and I saw his agonizing smile. I wanted to say something but my voice betrayed me and those were the last words I heard before my consciousness slipped away.",sadness
"""They're gone,"" he said in a soft voice but his words resonated across the room. ""And they're not coming back anymore.""",sadness
"""So she's really a Shinigami,"" Akira said and she looked dejected.",sadness
"His retort made me smile a little and I saw his lips moving, too. I missed the way we tease each other and I'm glad that he can still think thoroughly even though we're in a rough situation.",joy
"""That place?"" He gave me a menacing smile that sent chills down my spine.",fear
I was about to move but then I felt a presence around me. My senses were heightened by the anxiety and I slowly readied my weapon. My body tensed when I heard a sinister laugh but the park remained deserted.,fear
"Suddenly, the hair on my nape tingled and someone spoke near my ear.",fear
"My whole body seared, as if I was thrown into the fire. I can't breathe properly and my senses were slowly fading.",fear
The Shinigami pulled my hair and his face came into view. I don't know if I was hallucinating but his face was full of scars that I can't distinguish his features anymore.,fear
The intensity of his gaze was enough to make me nauseous but his words stung me like a venom and I remembered the memory I have seen earlier.,fear
"My heart beat increased its pace and it felt like both of my adrenaline and serotonin levels heightened. Just when I needed a diversion from all of these feelings, he suddenly reached his gun and fired at the left side.",fear
"The voice behind me sent shivers down my spine and the only thing I could do was using my sixth sense. I managed to stop the time around me but only for three seconds to reposition myself. When the time reached its limit, the Huntres shoved his shadow-like dagger to the place where I was three seconds ago.",fear
I heard him chuckle and that made me smile a little. I like this side of him more.,joy
"""Yes. Maybe I should've told you this before. Maybe you wouldn't get yourself involved with me after this, and maybe your feelings toward me will disappear and turn into something else.""",sadness
"His dumbfounded expression was replaced with a contemptuous smile and my heart has suddenly increased its pace. I recalled the reactions involved in attraction and love and this is one of the markers, unless I was feeling fear.",joy
"""Save yourself,"" he suddenly said and that made me stop for a second. ""I can't swim and I'll just be a burden to you. So please, leave me here and save—""",sadness
"""Thank you for not letting me go. Thank you for letting me see your face after that endless darkness.""",joy
"""Because she's a bit different and somehow similar to me. I saw myself in her,"" he said and the way he looked at me made me jittery.",fear
"He didn't say anything but he gently pulled me toward him and the next thing I knew, he was already hugging me. My head was spinning and my heart was ready to burst any moment now but his warmth calmed me down.",joy
"""This is Shima, the island of the damned,"" he said and the cries and screams of agony of the people inhabiting it filled my ears.",fear
I moved closer to him since the atmosphere felt disturbing and I don't want to be alone in this kind of place.,fear
Consecutive roars from the huge lion and leopard in front greeted us and I was rendered motionless due to fear and confusion. Their bodies were twice larger than the normal ones and they looked more ferocious.,fear
"I almost forgot to breathe when he said that and I got more cautious because of the danger that this place could offer. Some of the plants and trees we passed by emit strange odor and chemicals that, according to him, could paralyze or cause hallucination.",fear
"All of a sudden, the two other guys grabbed both of my arms while the one who was speaking pointed his spear at Mitsuo.",fear
"""Mitsuo!"" I called, frightened by the situation. I wanted to reach my fan but I couldn't move my arms due to their strength.",fear
"""What are you doing, Lionel?"" Mitsuo snarled while glaring at the guy.",anger
"Lionel and Mitsuo both looked at me and I just wanted to go to his side. In this unfamiliar place and situation, Mitsuo was the only one I could depend on.",fear
"""I'm sorry,"" he said.",sadness
"The guys dragged me away from them and I could feel the stinging pain from where they were holding me. Instead of yelling at them, I observed the surrounding and I almost gasped when I saw the crimson-colored ground.",fear
"""Curse you, fucking Jikko!"" the guy yelled and he spat on the ground.",anger
"The Executioner swung his scythe and I immediately closed the window. The guy howled in anger but after a few seconds, it disappeared. My body convulsed, imaging the scenario that just happened outside.",fear
"I smiled at her and she looked at me with curiosity. She might be too young to understand the concept but still, I wanted to tell her.",joy
"""Don't involve yourself with him anymore,"" he said with his piercing gaze, his scythe pointed at my direction.",anger
My body went rigid when I heard my whole name from his mouth. How did he . . .,fear
"Panic started to arise in my body as the volcanic ash and other matter coming out of the volcano. I ran towards the door, pounding it and screaming for help, but my voice was masked by the mass outcry happening inside my head.",fear
"""How dare you do this to me, Senshins! I'm going to kill all of you! Watch me!"" the woman screamed while vultures, crows and ravens circled around her, her naked body covered with cuts and wounds.",anger
"I clutched my stomach when I saw the vultures lunging at her wounds, as if they were hastening her death. One of the crows targeted her eyes and I instinctively closed my eyes, imagining the scenario if it was me in her place.",fear
Her wails and curses filled the air but my eyes flung open when I realized the owner of that voice—it was the Huntres we encountered on the sea.,fear
"""STOP! NO!"" the Huntres shrieked. ""I didn't mean it! Believe me! Please!""",fear
"I suddenly felt scared because unfamiliar memories were starting to fill and overwrite my mind and for a second, I couldn't remember my own memories anymore.",fear
"""For what reason?!"" I pointed my fan at his direction and the memories I was trying to remember a while ago were becoming vivid.",anger
I wanted to stop reading his memories but I found myself still looking through them until my parents' death. I clutched my chest because it felt like my heart would burst any second.,sadness
"""You disgust me,"" I said. ""How dare you question my parents' and our clan's loyalty when all they did was support the President!""",anger
"""It wasn't! Sir Hideyoshi treasured them as friends, and yet because of your doubts, he lost them . . . I lost them.""",anger
"His words stung like poison and I couldn't take it anymore. I swung my fan at his direction, ready to slit his throat, but something restricted my hand.",anger
"When I saw him, the remaining strength I was holding onto dissolved and triggered my tears. He pulled me into his chest and I cried my heart out.",sadness
"""Don't leave me here,"" I said, scared to lose my own thoughts again.",fear
"""All of the people here, the prisoners and even the Executioners, have their own share of madness. I thought I can protect you but I haven't considered your ability. It must've been hard for you. I'm sorry.",sadness
And I thought I was doing a great job of keeping it at the back of my mind.,sadness
Why are you crying?,sadness
"""It's just that . . . I don't know how to face Hideo anymore,"" I said while remembering our childhood.",sadness
"""I'm sorry for not telling you the truth,"" he said, breaking the silence.",sadness
"My tears automatically fell after hearing those words, remembering the hardships my parents went through because of the Council's ideas.",sadness
"""Why?"" I asked, trying my best to stay calm even if my face and mind were already a mess.",sadness
"""From the bottom of my heart, I am sorry for hurting you like this,"" he said while bowing for apology",sadness

"""Hideo . . ."" I checked him and he seemed troubled. ""Calm yourself.""",fear
"""No one's leaving this place,"" Hideo warned and his eyes found her.",fear
"""I am done with all of you so stop this bullshit,"" she harshly said but I could read her mind.",anger
"""Yes,"" I breathed. I was afraid not for myself but for the life inside me. I do not know what to do.",fear
"""I'm sorry,"" he whispered.",sadness
I am not worthy to be someone's father. I don't deserve this. I—,sadness
But it's the truth. My hands were already soaked in people's blood. I've killed hundreds of people. Someone as filthy as me can't have something so pure.,sadness
"""No. Sorry,"" he said and he hugged me.",sadness
"""It's just that . . . I don't want the both of you to be labeled as an Executioner's wife and child. But I'll do anything to protect you so you don't need to worry. I made this choice so I will do anything to keep you out of danger.""",sadness

"Yes, for he is the greatest gift you have given me, and a reminder that he should protect you when I'm not around.",joy
"""I hope we could attend this festival next year together with Nathan,"" I said and he just smiled.",joy

"""I'm sorry for giving this kind of task to you,"" he said in an apologetic tone.",sadness
I promised that I wouldn't cry anymore after giving birth to Nathan but his words were stirring up my emotions.,sadness
"""Of course,"" I said. ""We've been helping each other since we were young. You don't need to worry.""",joy

He's . . . in a state of coma.,fear

"Some Executioners halted, others took a glance at me, as I walked beside Farallon. The older ones were able to recognize me as the child who had red eyes.",joy
"""Naia?"" One of the called. ""Is that you, Naia?""",joy
"""Yuma,"" I replied. ""You look old now.""",joy
"He drew his sword and I swiftly fended off his attack. Some Executioners gathered around, bellowing and cheering, as the two of us were caught in an onslaught.",fear
"He was still fast and agile despite his age. I could feel the cuts on my skin, blood streaming through my arms. I managed to land a gash on his cheeks and he looked more excited.",joy
"""Damn, child, you better not underestimate me,"" he beamed as he charged at me.",anger
"That moment, my skin tingled as I felt an intense bloodlust from him.",fear
"""The unprepared are the first to die.""",sadness
"I remembered what I told to Jett and cursed myself for being too softhearted. This was Shima, a place where comrades could kill one another without giving a thought.",fear
"He disappeared from my sight, and the next thing I knew, the tip of his blade was already piercing through my right shoulder.",anger
I gritted my teeth in pain and held his sword.,anger
I kicked his neck as I my hands bled while gripping his blade.,anger
The force made him lose his balance and grip on the sword and I immediately pulled it out of my flesh.,fear
Yuma sat up and laughed hysterically as he looked at me.,joy
"Shit, this is bad, he chuckled. ""I want to kill you now.""",anger
"He was ready to charged at me but everyone suddenly fell silent. I felt the immense pressure in the atmosphere, making my body tremble in fear.",fear
W-what was that? I mumbled.,fear
"Amidst the silence, I heard heavy footsteps approaching our direction. The Executioners gave way and I saw a hooded man walking toward us.",fear
The tattered cloak fluttered as the wind howled. Behind him was a woman who was eerily familiar. Then I remembered Nel's story about a Senshin who had the eyes of a Shinigami and a Custos.,fear
"As far as I remembered, Lionel should be the de-facto leader since Ise lost his only heir when Vince died. I was sure Lionel didn't look like that when I left Shima.",sadness
"""Child, state your name,"" he demanded and I flinched upon hearing his voice.",fear
"""I see. The child of Diona and Heron,"" he said and my stomach churned in distress as I heard my parents' names.",anger
He carefully removed his hood and I almost got paralyzed by his stare. Intense and cold green eyes looked right into mine.,fear
"""W-who are you?"" I asked, my voice shaking in fear.",fear
He bellowed in laughter as if my question was something funny.,anger
"""A Jikko branch clan member,"" he responded. ""That old fart didn't even talk to me until he needed someone to inherit his position.""",sadness
"Some Executioners were visibly uncomfortable after hearing him badmouthing Ise. I, too, felt annoyed as Ise was the most respectable person in this island.",anger
"""I vowed to hunt down every single Shinigami but they locked me up in this place""",anger
He seethed and I had to step back because his anger screamed danger.,fear
"""Damn that council of old and coward shitheads.""",anger
"""Dad, calm down,"" the woman behind him softly said.",fear
It had been three hours since I arrived in Shima yet I had already learned about what happened here after Ise and Vince died.,sadness
"Shira snuggled me and I could hear the guttural sound he was making, as if asking some attention.",sadness
"Man, you haven't change at all, I snickered while caressing his mane.",joy
I stayed at the shore of the island as they decide what to do with me and the prisoners I had to transfer using the Senshins and Custos technology.,fear
"Heaving a sigh, I stared at the endless sea.",sadness
I reached for my weapon as I turned my head around and saw that girl. Speaking of the devil.,fear
She walked toward my direction and Shira started snarling at her.,anger
"Calm down, boy, I said.",anger
The girl sat beside me and looked at the gray sky. She smiled and it felt so genuine that I let my guard down for a second.,joy
"""You know, when I first arrived here, I thought I was going to die. This time, for real""",fear
"""I, too, was bringing criminals from the Nox and Sir Hideo told me that I should brace myself when I set foot here. I thought it was because of this island's reputation. I thought it was because of this island's reputation.""",fear
She glanced at me and her eyes were so distracting. Her iridescent irises where beautiful and nauseating at the same time.,joy
"""I was attacked by the Executioners the moment I landed. I was a fighter, too, but their strength were on a different level. It felt like I was fighting a Huntres with an instinct of a Senshin. It was terrifying.""",fear
My lips curved upward. Hearing that compliment for the Jikko clan was uplifting.,joy
"""My plan was to leave the criminals, deliver a news, and go back to Tantei High, but everything changed when their leader came to meet me.""",fear
"""It must be shocking,"" I commented.",fear
"She chuckled in response. ""Not really. My Dad is strong and stubborn so deep in my heart, I knew he was still alive, despite being labeled as missing in the records of the Senshins.""",sadness
"The only ones we were told to be wary about in the Senshin tribe were the remnants of the Great Seven, and some of the professors.",fear
"""But I didn't expect to see him here. Dad never liked positions.""",anger
"""Well, he's still a Jikko,"" I said. ""And when . . . when Vince died, the main family had no heir to replace him as the future leader.""",sadness
"I glanced at her, my brows furrowed, unsure if I heard that right.",anger
Huh? What do you mean?,fear
That name triggered a certain memory. I remembered the woman Vince brought here when she returned for a while. It was just a brief time but she was the first friend I had.,sadness
I stifled a gasp upon hearing that. Vince and Nathalie? They . . . they had a child?,sadness
"Where are the criminals you are talking about? he asked, but it sounded like a demand.",anger
Maintaining my composure was difficult in front of this Kyo. His presence was enough to feel his superiority and strength.,fear
There were still pools of blood on the ground and vultures were quietly looming above us. Some of the Executioners were preparing a huge pot of boiling oil and setting up several bamboo stakes.,fear
"""Who's going to be tortured?""",anger
"The look on their faces was a mixture of nausea, confusion and anger",fear
"Despite their feet and hands being bound, few of them started attacking the people around . . . which was a wrong and dumb move.",anger
"""This one's mine!""",anger
"""Humdrums are, indeed, stupid.""",anger
"""Couple of Erityians, too.""",anger
"""How does that feel?"" Yuma taunted as he pointed his scythe to an Executive neck. ""Your members are being toyed by an 11-year old Jikko.""",anger
"""A traitor like you,"" Yuma said as the tip of his scythe digging through Eerie's skin, ""brings shame to the Senshin tribe.""",anger
"My skin crawled upon hearing that familiar voice and when I turned around, I saw Lionel walking toward our direction.",fear
"""I have finished cleaning the Rei level,"" he reported to Kyo.",joy
"""Good,"" Kyo responded and Lionel went to the Nox's direction. ""Reliable as ever,"" he commented.",joy
"""Of course,"" I said. ""He's been Vince's rival since they were young. Strength wise, he's probably second to you.""",sadness
"""You're right,"" he chuckled. ""But potential-wise, that brat is higher than him.""",joy
"I shuddered when I felt his presence getting stronger and I had to step back to not get overwhelmed. When I looked at him, his grin was nowhere to be found and it was replaced with a grim expression.",fear
"""Okay. I'll be counting on you.""",joy
He silently walked away and I was left alone. I wanted to contact the CIA but communication outside was forbidden in this island.,sadness
It's been 36 hours since I arrived here and I was still adjusting to the intensity of voices inside my head.,fear
My range had improved and I could now hear the cries and howls in the prisons. It was draining but I was used to this kind of exhaustion since I was a child.,joy
I suddenly remembered how Nathalie almost lost her memories before because of these voices.,sadness
That must be really scary.,fear
"Hearing a voice inside my head, which was neither a scream of pain nor cries from mind torture, made me flinch. Who . . . wait . . .",sadness
"Nathalie looked at my direction, a hint of surprise on her face, but after a few seconds, she smiled, as if she had finally recognized me.",joy
Then my eyes drifted to the guy beside him and I halted when I saw his face.,fear
"""This pisses me off,"" Kyo grumbled. ""It's like looking at those two brats' faces.""",anger
"Nathalie chuckled. ""I know what you mean, Sir Kyo. Well, Hideo raised him so he kinda got his personality.""",joy
"""You kid,"" he said while looking at the guy.",anger
Wow. He's got guts. I'll give him that.,anger
Kyo grinned as if he just found someone to toy with.,joy
"""Too much noise.""",anger
"""You probably should not stay here,"" I said and he looked at me. ""Seems like you have the same ability as Nathalie.""",anger
That was the first time I saw someone greatly affected by the thoughts and inner voices of people despite our capability to block them.,sadness
"""You can hear inner voices despite their closed minds, right?"" He nodded.",fear
"""You sure you can handle the agony and pain of the tortured? The heinous and brutal thoughts of the prisoners? The radical ways and thoughts of the executioners?""",fear
He winced before he could answer my questions. I knew it. Those voices must be causing a discomfort and pain on his mind.,sadness
I stared at him for a few seconds. I wasn't sure if he was confident or just foolish.,sadness
"Amid the silence, I could hear faint voices, screams of agony and desperation from the prisoners.",sadness
"Within a splitsecond, I drew my sword and swung it to his direction.",anger
"Shock and confusion came into his face, and he leapt back, avoiding a serious cut on his neck. I pulled back my sword and looked at him.",anger
"""Seems like your flight instincts have been honed,"" I remarked as blood trickled from his neck.",joy
"""But, kiddo, Jikkos are known for fighting, not evading. I guess you aren't ready to inherit that name yet.""",anger
My words seemed to struck a chord and the look on his eyes instantly changed.,fear
I was caught off-guard for a second because he looked exactly like Vince when he's pissed.,fear
"""Kiddo? You seem like just a few years older than me,"" he commented.",anger
"""I call everyone weaker than me a kiddo,"" I retorted, and somehow it felt good.",joy
I didn't know taunting someone who could talk back would be this entertaining since Jett and Cliff would always give up before I could enjoy the conversation.,joy
"Before his hand could reach for something behind him, I lunged at him and gripped his arm.",anger
"I snatched his gun as he fell on his back and pointed it at him. I fired two bullets on each side of his head, just a few inches from his ears.",anger
"""What? Did you life flash right before your eyes?"" I taunted.",joy
A smile escaped my lips as I remembered how they described Vince's death.,joy
"I felt an intense pressure behind us and when I turned around, Kyo and Nathalie was already walking toward our direction.",fear
"I glanced at the guy who just got up and kept glaring at me. ""He'd lose to Karim,"" I replied.",anger
"""Too slow. Too weak. Too emotional. Too self-centered. If I'm an Executioner, I won't offer my trust and loyalty to someone who can't even defend himself.""",anger
Kyo bellowed in laughter while Nathalie looked conflicted.,joy
"That kid's presence was overwhelming, maybe the most intense among the Executioners besides Kyo, but that wouldn't mean anything if his body couldn't keep up.",fear
"""No filters and sugarcoating, huh? I like that,"" Kyo commented.",joy
"I scoffed. ""I don't like toning down my words. A weak must know he's weak, otherwise, he'd be complacent.""",anger
"""Naia . . ."" Nathalie called, a look of worry flashed on her face.",fear
"""I'm sorry, Nathalie. I'm just saying the truth. Well then, I need to rest.""",sadness
I started walking away from them. Kyo was still chuckling but the two remained silent.,joy
"My words might be harsh but this place is harsher. His naivety would just cause more harm. If it was the other Executioners that challenged him, he'd be dead by now. He should have prepared himself before setting foot here.",fear
"I was on my way to my cabin when I saw Aristus standing near it. ""Aristus!"" I called as I ran toward his direction.",joy
"He smiled upon seeing me. ""Naia.""",joy
"""I just learned that you're here,"" he softly said. ""And also Nathalie . . . and his son.""",joy
"""I arrived yesterday and you just heard it today?"" I noted as I squinted my eyes. ""How many days did you spend inside your cave this time?""",anger
"He chuckled nervously. ""Uh, a week, I think?""",fear
"""Learning and writing our history is fun. You should try it,"" he remarked as his eyes twinkled in excitement.",joy
"His enthusiasm about it made me retch. Aristus is the weakest here in terms of physical abilities, but the Executioners respect his vast knowledge about our race.",joy
"Aristus smirked and glanced at the isolated part of the island, which was called blood chamber, because of the red-dyed ground due to the volcano and keimusho.",joy
"""Still as persuasive as ever, huh?""",anger
"Despite closing my mind, I could still hear voices inside my head as we got nearer.",fear
Nathalie and Hiro would probably lose their minds the moment they stepped into this chamber.,fear
The temperature in this place took up a notch and I started sweating profusely.,fear
I already took off my coat and tied my hair but Aristus seemed unaffected. How could he still look comfortable with that mantle covering his body? Damn monster.,anger
"I breathed deeply and willed myself to stay calm. ""Yeah. It's just . . . it's been a while since I last went here.""",anger
It became hotter as we descended and it felt like my skin and bones would just melt.,fear
I could also hear the screams and cries of the prisoners and it made my head throb in pain.,sadness
Blood was splattered across his face and his blonde hair was dyed with scarlet hues. His green eyes gleamed in the dimly lit space and my skin crawled when he smiled at us.,fear
"""Ah. I just finished questioning this one,"" he said as he lifted the guy by grabbing his hair.",anger
"""That's good,"" Aristus commented. ""I need more information.""",joy
"""I already know where that Custos is,"" Lionel said, smirking. ""Ah. I wonder what kind of punishment I should give him.""",anger
"I shuddered upon hearing his words. Dale was an elusive target, even for us, yet he was already thinking of how he could make his life miserable.",fear
This guy . . . he might be more frightening than Kyo. And those two are the current main force of the Jikko clan. I wonder if that kid could hold a candle to them.,fear
"""Really?"" I muttered as Farallon readied the boat",anger
"""That's the rule, kid,"" he said. ""You can't communicate with others within the island.""",anger
I was left alone in the middle of the sea and I realized there was a brewing storm nearby.,fear
"""Damn it,"" I muttered while getting the device the Commander gave me.",anger
"""Naia,"" he greeted. ""Good to hear from you. What happened?""",joy
"""The criminals have been transferred successfully, Commander,"" I reported.",sadness
Farallon still couldn't believe that those beasts could still remember me and I was the only one that could cuddle them.,joy
"""I heard you went to the blood chamber with Aristus,"" he said and my body almost trembled when I remembered what happened there.",fear
"""Yeah. It was like coming back from hell.""",fear
"He snickered. ""Right. Remember when you first went there? Vince had to get you away from that place because it triggered your eyes.""",joy
"Ise said I wasn't allowed to be in the blood chamber because I was still too young and weak, but I wanted to see it. Besides, I admire both Vince and Lionel, even vowing to be their apprentice, but they both dismissed me.",sadness
"Fortunately, Ise had already taught me how to conceal my presence and both of their attention were on the criminals so it was quite easy for me to follow..",joy
"I thought I was doing a good job, until something happened",fear
"I heard voices, several of them, crying and howling in agony and pain.",fear
My head felt like it would burst any minute.,fear
"When I was in the island, I never heard those voices that loud but upon stepping onto the blood chamber, I realized why they never allowed those who hadn't trained yet.",fear
"It slowed me down but I thought I could control my mind. However, something made it much more complicated.",fear
"The next thing I knew, he was already grinning menacingly at my direction. Everything happened so fast that I only realized my situation when I was already held by my neck.",fear
"As a kid, I was beyond terrified. The prisoner took me as a hostage.",fear
My neck was pressed between his chest and arms as my body dangled. The tip of the knife was digging through my cheeks and blood began to trickle down my face.,fear
I was terrified and I felt something was changing in my mind and body.,fear
Colors flickered in my irises and I saw a lot of people getting slaughtered and skinned by the knife that was poking me.,fear
"Fear coursed through my body, not because of my situation, but because of Vince and Lionel.",fear
Their eyes gleamed malevolently as they swung their scythes in the air.,anger
"""Get her out of here,"" Lionel seethed as he looked at the rest of the prisoners who were as terrified as I was.",anger
Vince immediately carried me and I remembered crying because he got angry at me.,sadness
"Wow. I couldn't believe that was already a long time ago,"" I said as I smiled, remembering Vince's life before he went away and died.",sadness
"""Yeah. And now all we have is his skinny brat.""",anger
"""Can this be used in, say, a fight against a Shinigami?"" he asked but before Aristus could reply, Farallon was already charging at their direction.",fear
"""Yes it can, brat,"" he said. ""this blade has been bathed by Shinigamis' blood since it was made.""",anger
"""Yes, that's his real attitude. He only acts quiet to look like Lionel but the truth is he's a lot more savage than Vince.""",anger
"""Naia,"" she called. ""Sorry if I wasn't able to talk to you.""",sadness
"""But I'm glad I got to see you again.""",joy
"She smiled. ""I will, Sir.""",joy
"""You rascal, you're really his son.""",anger
"""Let's go back,"" he ordered and the pressure of his presence was so heavy that I felt like my knees would buckle.",fear
It seems like we'll get a lot of prisoners in the coming days.,joy
"That moment, I realized the Erityian race was slowly shifting . . . but I don't know if it's for the better or worse.",fear
"After visiting the blood chamber, the voices I heard kept echoing inside my head.",sadness
I was itching to fight someone,anger
"By nightfall, everything in the island was already engulfed in darkness.",fear
Hearing that voice made me shudder.,fear
My hands instinctively reached my sword and swung it at the presence behind me.,anger
"Blood splattered on my face and on the floor, stunned to see Kiyoko's smiling face.",fear
That made me chuckle since that was quite true. Being eccentric and radical is the normal here,joy
"""After what happened to Senshins and Custos, a lot of criminals will be transferred here,"" she explained. ""They are preparing for that.""",fear
"""Yeah."" A hint of sadness flashed across her face.",sadness
"""And you know furious they are at them.""",anger
Vince's face zoomed inside my head and how the rest of the Jikko clan acted when they received the news of his death.,fear
"""Because of what happened, they even harbor resentment to Hideyoshi and the administration,"" she continued.",anger
"""Ise completely cut the communication between them because trusting them cost him his grandson's life.""",anger
My heart almost sank upon hearing Ise's name. I grew up with Vince and Ise was particularly strict on him.,sadness
He would always say that he should never lose a fight because that's a disgrace as a Jikko.,anger
"She smiled. ""Yup. Apparently, he sneaked out of this island when he was a teenager because if he stayed, he'd be named as the chief of the village.""",joy
"Although some of my memories were hazy, I remembered Ise getting furious when a letter suddenly arrived from the outside.",anger
Yeah. The fate he wanted to avoid caught up to him. I guess he was really meant to lead this clan before the true heir steps in.,sadness
My nerves finally calmed down after talking to Kiyoko. I was grateful that she came here.,joy
My breath caught in my throat as I stared at her. It didn't even occur to me that she didn't have any idea about what happened to team Magnus. Her eyes looked at me expectantly and I felt awful after remembering his last moments.,sadness
"""I . . . I'm sorry,"" I mumbled, my voice trembling.",sadness
"Her expression tightened and before I could explain anything, she had already averted my gaze. I could feel an overwhelming pressure from her presence and I willed myself not to step back even though it was getting suffocating",fear
"Kiyoko started walking away without a word. I heaved a sigh, worried about what she would do. Nel said Kiyoko was nice and sweet but her expression a while ago was far from that.",sadness
"My body automatically reacted to his presence, jumping back and assuming a defensive stance. Kyo burst out laughing after seeing what I did.",joy
Damn it. Why was he even here?,anger
"He cackled. ""Reds are so hard to persuade.""",joy
"""Besides, I'm a Keeper,"" I added and smiled. ""I am needed to make sure everyone stays alive.""",joy
"A subtle smile appeared on my lips. ""I think so, too. But I prefer this kind of life now.""",joy
"""Well, that's disappointing,"" he commented while scratching his head.",sadness
"""What an arrogant brat you are.""",anger
"""Thank you, Commander,"" Nel said.",joy
There was a few seconds of silence and it looked like they were planning something.,fear
"After our encounters with the Nox, Nel was becoming more and more like a captain.",joy
"Well, I couldn't sleep the whole time I was there and staying there was mentally draining, I wanted to say but I just smiled instead.",sadness
"Before I could explain how far I was from Romania, she had already ended the call. That freaking girl. Did she just cut me off? Damn it. I'm going to break her bones once I get there.",anger
But . . . I didn't expect I'd miss their voices that much. I couldn't wait to be with them again.,sadness
It felt strange to be alone in this still and silent ocean after staying for days in Shima,fear
"An hour later, I received a holographic call from Cliff. His face flickered in front of me, and even though the quality wasn't good, I could see the horror on his expression.",fear
"He drew a shaky breath and I realized he was still gripping the seatbelt tightly. ""We're going to die.""",fear
"""Oh, c'mon, you cowards!""",anger
"Cliff was on the passenger's seat, horrified as the car seemed to accelerate.",fear
Nel looked thrilled after days of being confined.,fear
"And there at the back seat was Jett, whose face was already as white as chalk.",fear
"I heaved a sigh. ""Nel, stop tormenting their poor souls.""",anger
"It turned out I needed at least three days to go there so in the end, I couldn't participate.",sadness
"Well, she said they could only bring two companions so I guess she really didn't need me to be there.",sadness
"""Alright, don't worry, I'll keep you three alive.""",joy
"""I think I'll die before we can reach Romania—""",sadness
"Before I could see his expression, the line went off. I was alone again in this vast ocean.",sadness
"""Be careful. There are Shinigami and Nox bases in Europe.""",sadness
"I was still in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and it would take me a day to reach Japan. Fortunately, my devices were working well.",joy
"Fortunately, everyone seemed to be humdrums. ""It's safe,"" I concluded.",joy
"My lips curved up, remembering their terrified expression a few hours ago.",joy
"Want me to carry you? Cliff asked, chuckling. ""Kiddi—!"" Before he could even tell he was just joking, Nel was already climbing on his back.",joy
"Jett started walking, maybe afraid that Nel might do that to him, too.",fear
"""See that yellow tree over there?"" I said, raising my voice.",anger
"Something's written here, Jett remarked and I told Nel to look at the boulder.",fear
"They followed the direction but they halted when the path ended with a cave. ""Should we enter this?"" asked Cliff.",fear
"It took them thirty minutes to finally find the exit, but before I could see it, the connection was cut. I couldn't hear nor see anything.",sadness
"""Hello? Nel? Cliff? Jett?"" Nothing. I tried calling them again but to no avail. They weren't responding",sadness
"For a second, I was worried, thinking that they got buried before they could leave the cave.",sadness
I threw my device on the raft and heaved a sigh. I wanted to know what was going on but there were no ways to contact them anymore.,sadness
I just hope they are safe.,fear
"""Yeah. That kid is cool.""",joy
Nel was too excited to tell me what happened during the meeting of the four tribes.,joy
"Honestly, I didn't expect it to be successful because of the Shinigami tribe.",joy
"Neo-classical buildings, museums and monuments were scattered all over the city. It felt like I was pulled back in the medieval period because of the architecture and arts around me.",joy
He went inside the building and vanished from my sight.,sadness
"Every step I took echoed through the room. When I arrived at the central hall, I almost got decapitated.",fear
"""Who are you?"" a seven-foot tall man demanded as he swung his sword.",fear
"They all lunged at me, their weapons ranging from blades to blunt to guns.",fear
"My mind was suddenly filled with angry and agonizing voices, as if I was back in Shima.",anger
"Rage and thirst filled my head. The next thing I knew, the polished floor was already flooded with blood.",anger
"Within a minute, the only one left was the first guy who discovered me. His hands were trembling as he pointed his sword at my direction.",fear
"Before he could take a step backward, my sword had already pierced his throat.",anger
"""Hi,"" I greeted.",joy
"They didn't greet me back. Instead, they seethed in rage as they saw the scarlet floor where their lifeless comrades were.",anger
I was about to make the first move but I halted when I saw people coming behind them.,fear
"My blood ran cold when I saw two children, a girl and a boy and maybe about seven to ten years old, stood in front of them, their eyes vacant of feelings.",fear
I drew a deep breath trying to calm myself but seeing those two made it difficult.,anger
A wave of fury stirred in my chest as they commanded the children to attack me.,anger
My heart tightened as both of them lurched at me.,anger
"When I looked at the two kids, they crumbled down on their knees and collapsed.",sadness
I let my rage control me.,anger
"With my sword bathed in blood, I slashed everyone at every direction.",anger
Cursing them inside my head after what they did to those children.,anger
It took me a few seconds to calm down.,anger
"When I looked around, a shiver went down my spine.",fear
Nel looked horrified as he stared at the bloodbath but her expression softened when he saw the two kids lying unconscious on the floor.,fear
I heaved a sigh as lifeless bodies in a pool of blood surrounded me.,sadness
"I smiled at them. ""Sorry, I can't be a good Keeper.""",sadness
"With my remaining strength, I walked at their direction. Finally, we were together again.",joy
"After what had happened in Romania, they seemed to be more nervous around me.",fear
"I had been suppressing my Executioner instinct since I left the island a few days ago, vowing not to let my emotions control me, but I lost it during the mission.",sadness
"I had been seeing those flashes since I first held this gun, which was several years ago already, but they still bothered me every time.",sadness
"""Are you going to retrieve this from me?"" I asked. ""Is it too dangerous in my hands?""",fear
"""You look dangerous even without any weapon. Don't you know how scary you are?""",fear
I failed to suppress a smile after hearing that from him.,sadness
"""So, you're not for this,"" I noted.",sadness
"""His expression darkened.""",anger
I could feel the tension on his shoulders as he continued playing with his pistol.,fear
"""Aren't you terrified after seeing that?"" I returned.",fear
"""I think you're stronger than Nel,"" Cliff remarked which earned him a punch from Nel.",anger
"""Why did you even become a Keeper?"" Jett added. ""You belong in the frontline"".",anger
I heaved a sigh and smiled,joy
"I was a wild kid back then. You know, when I arrived in our headquarters, the first thing I did was pick a fight with the Commander.",anger
"""Well, I was raised . . . differently, so I didn't know how to act in front of people.""",sadness
I couldn't continue what I was going to say because of the sudden turbulence. A holograph flickered on the windows of the plane and Commander's face appeared in front of us.,fear
"""Team Optimus, well done,"" he said, ""but I have another mission for you and this takes priority.""",joy
"The four of us exchanged looks and nodded. ""Roger!""",joy
His face flickered and disappeared after sending the message. The air was suddenly filled with tension,fear
"Jett shuffled his guns, getting ready in case a commotion breaks out.",anger
Jett and I exchanged nervous looks,fear
"My mouth hung open when I saw two figures scrunched down the floor. Zeno and Dale were bloodied, just like the rest of the Executives.",fear
Von had visible gunshots on his shoulders and leg but he didn't seem to mind them. Fenn had it worse. He had deep cuts on his hands and a long gash from his right to left cheek.,fear
"That was a lot dangerous than the headgear invented by the Senshins. But to contain the Nox leaders, I guess they had to take risks, especially against their dangerous animus.",fear
Dale could turn invisible for a few seconds and Zeno could paralyze the nerves of a person using his blood.,sadness
"""This marks the end of Nox,"" Von said as he looked at Dale with a pained expression.",sadness

"And? Why aren't you with them? You're an Elite, too, right?",fear
"""I can't face them,"" he muttered.",fear
"So, you're going to give up your status?",sadness
Huh? What do you mean?,anger
Brat?,anger
Tsk. Hope he gives up now.,sadness
"""Merry Christmas,"" I mumbled. ""Sleep well.""",joy
What the heck are you doing?,anger
"""Why? Want me to stay?"" he taunted.",fear
"""No,"" I muttered as I rolled my eyes",sadness
Why don't you just tell him directly that you don't want to be part of the rebellion?,fear
Do you think that brat won't be?,anger
"""I see,"" I muttered. ""Then, goodbye, I guess?""",sadness
There was a hint of fear on her face. M-Ma'am Michiko?,fear
"""I'll be going,"" he said. ""If you miss me, you know where to find me.""",sadness
Thinking about him again?,sadness
Wait—!,anger
"""Hideo,"" Naomi called in a controlled manner. Calm down.",anger
"""Good luck,"" she teased.",fear
"""Haruka, stop,"" he ordered and I couldn't believe she was here",anger
"""Piss off, Keith,"" he retorted.",anger
"He chuckled at her grumbling. ""Calm down.""",anger
"""Curious, aren't you?"" he smirked. ""You're getting careless with your thoughts now.""",anger
"But don't you, Shinigamis, dislike them?",fear
"""Dead,"" he flatly said.",sadness
"""Don't worry, I didn't kill him,"" he added as his lips curved upward. ""He died of natural causes.""",fear
What the heck?! How could he say those words with a nonchalant expression?! At seryoso ba siya?! Anong pinagsasabi niya?!,anger
What? We were practically living together when you took care of me—,sadness
"""Okay, stop!"" I yelled, completely flustered.",anger
"""That's a shame,"" he said as he steered me out of his room.",anger
"""Time's up!"" Vivien shouted.",anger
"""Hey,"" she greeted.",joy
"""No, no, that's not how it worked,"" Hiroshi grunted before Hayate noticed us.",sadness
That's definitely scary.,fear
Damn brat.,anger
"""I broke his arm,"" he muttered, earning a frown from me. ""Accidentally.""",sadness
"""What are you doing?"" he groggily asked, his eyes still closed.",fear
"""Ah, shit, I forgot that I'm meeting Keith,"" he cursed under his breath.",anger
Such a liar.,anger
"Humans are creature of change and among the living, they have the best abilities to adapt.",joy
"By the end of the 19th century, these unique speciation of humans were known within their own race as Erityians—a name befitting of their origins and capabilities—the children of the special blood.",joy
"Perfectly blending in with the normal humans, they have saved and destroyed civilizations and lives.",sadness
"Worn out, Emiko reached for her son in the arms of the elder. ""M-my son . . . give me my son . . .""",anger
"""Monster!"" she yelled as she attempted to leave the house, but he was faster.",anger
You shall never talk about our eyes' peculiarity to anybody. Hear me?,fear
"But those people are also throwing hate to us, aren't they? Why can I not do the same, brother?",anger
"I know it is hard, but father told us not to hate them. Father is a kind man, and he wants us to be like that, too.",joy
"Too much and the greedy and the wicked will take advantage of it. Father is kind, but also naïve.",anger
"""Quick,"" he said, cutting off Ryo. ""Leave this place.""",anger
Father! Why are you—,fear
"""F-father,"" he called. ""People . . . there are people heading here.""",fear
"The truth is, I have always hated humans, but I do not want you to share the same sentiment because not all of them are bad.",anger
"No matter how hard it is, live well, Sho, Ryo. Live and prove that it is not a sin to be alive just because we are different.",joy
"""W-what happened—"" Ryo's body stiffened when he recalled what had transpired before passing out. ""Father!""",fear
Father! No!,fear
"""Father!"" cried Ryo as he ran toward Shotaro.",sadness
"""We cannot allow them to see this,"" Sho remarked",fear
Perhaps we really are monsters. Father's eyes. Your eyes. Even the mystery surrounding mother's death and our clan.,sadness
"""And what if there are, brother?"" he returned. ""Do you think they are treated differently from us? People who are different from the normal will always be regarded as outcasts. As freaks. As monsters.""",anger
"What . . . what did you do, Ryo?",fear
I continued father's unfinished business.,anger
"""Ryo, tell me . . . how many did you . . .""",fear
I only killed those who attacked us first.,anger
"We need to leave this village, Ryo.",fear
They said our clan was once a proud lineage of samurais.,joy
We should quietly leave the house.,fear
"Do not soak your hands in more blood, brother.",fear
But how? We are already surrounded.,fear
I cannot let you die here.,anger
"See the world by yourself. I am staying here, and I will take back what they have stolen from us: our clan's honor, our wealth, and father's pride. Farewell, brother.",anger
"I promise, even the gods of death cannot stop me. For father and for you, I will become one of them.",anger
"In our tribe, names of the dead are avoided, but my parents gave his name to me because they want me gone.",sadness
"""Ishida . . ."" the kid murmured as his eyes twinkled in excitement.",joy
"You cannot protect yourself just by running away, especially when danger is always looming. Sometimes, you have to toughen up.",sadness
"""N-no . . ."" she pleaded",fear
"""See?"" he beamed. ""You have nothing to be afraid of.""",joy
"""So you need not to hide your eyes anymore,"" he added",joy
"I have never experienced summer, but the warmth of your presence must feel like it. From now on, you are Natsue.",joy
"She reached for his hand and smiled. ""I'm happy . . . thank you . . .""",joy
"Farewell, brother.",sadness
"I will return, and I will see you again.",sadness
"""S-spare me!"" the next guy pleaded.",fear
Now you're asking for mercy.,anger
"P-please, I have a fam—",fear
It's already too late for you to implore the very thing you stripped away from us.,anger
"S-stay away, or I'm going to kill her!",anger
Are you going to stand there all night?,anger
"A-apologies, my lord.",sadness
"M-my apologies, lord, this—",fear
"Even with this power, someone like me will remain as a burakumin until death.",sadness
Such is the fate of those who were born in the lowest class.,sadness
"Apologies, my lord.",sadness
"One day, the great powers of the natural elements will be passed onto those who are worthy, as what our great ancestor Czeslav has foreknown.",joy
S-stay away.,fear
"""Yllka,"" her mother softly called, cupping her face. "" Look at me. Are you hurt?",fear
Hold it firmly!,anger
They're marching here! Be ready!,fear
"You're going to burn the forest, too!",fear
Douse the fire!,anger
"""Your eyes,"" he murmured. ""They've become lighter in color.""",fear
"Well done, Yllka.",joy
Being an espion . . . is it hard?,fear
They must be strong enough to infiltrate and escape bases; and have the wits to gather information and conduct counterintelligence against enemies.,fear
Why does the country you serve forsake you once the enemies tracked you down?,sadness
"But I am not normal, aren't I? Why? Am I cursed, mother?",sadness
"My child, listen to me. Being different may be difficult, but it does not mean you are cursed. Perhaps it is one of our ancestors' will.",sadness
"A mind unfettered will be favored. Humanity will continue to progress, whether we like it or not, and those who will, may receive the consciousness of the gods and the power of natural forces.",sadness
"If you see your father, tell him I went ahead.",sadness
Be the greatest espion that has ever graced the world.,joy
"And perhaps . . . I am at the end of the line, too.",sadness
"I-I can help you, Father. Let's just get out of here—",fear
"I truly am sorry for making you do this, but it has to be you. This is the only way I can save the both of us.",sadness
"The guy looked surprised, but a relieved smile grew on his face. ""I knew it. We really are alike. The name is Hagen,"" he introduced.",joy
"Hagen, join me. We shall be the keepers and guardians of the world's secrets.",joy
"It escalated quickly, and before he could realize, some civilians were . . .",fear
What have I done? Where is Ishida? What did . . .,fear
"""I-It's . . ."" she looked at Shinji, still in disbelief",fear
He grimaced at the news.,anger
"A precise single strike, he mentally noted as he aimed for the neck, but his plan was immediately thwarted by the samurais by his side.",anger
"""Who are you?!""",anger
Kill him!,anger
You could have been a great retainer.,anger
Get me out of here!,fear
M-monster! Kill him! Now!,anger
"Now, pay the price with your life.",anger
"Announce your appellation and purpose, intruder.",anger
The rivers are in our territory.,anger
But Chief—,fear
I must disembark here.,sadness
"How did you do this, Chief?",fear
Why must it be here?!,anger
"Edda's stare was enough to silence the crew. I shall only bring Hagen and Morgan. The rest of you must survive if things do not go well. Now, go!",anger
Is this truly the center of the world?,fear
"Edda grinned as soon as she saw the people onboard. ""The green-eyed ones are participating.""",joy
I am pleased to finally meet you.,joy
Pardon me if I was late.,fear
"However, your attendant seems to harbor animosity toward us.",anger
"Ishida, remember your verdict.",anger
I am just worried about my lord's safety.,fear
"""Brother,"" he returned with a glower on his face.",sadness
I want to get back home as soon as possible.,joy
Your agents must be good that they can infiltrate even the farthest lands.,anger
"Yllka clenched her fist. ""Are there intruders in our villages? What are you planning?""",anger
"The powers we possess can change the world, Edda stated.",joy
"They are incredible but terrifying, hence I chose to stay in the shadows. I suppose you have done the same.",fear
Humans are awful.,anger
Our once vast home was reduced to several villages cramped in a single mountain.,anger
All they did was take resources and invade lands.,anger
I do not trust them.,anger
"""Enough of that nonsense, brother,"" Ryo exclaimed",anger
"Kindness is not something you give to anyone, and I have nothing to spare to those humans you wish to keep from harm.",anger
How about building a new nation?,joy
"Instead of hiding from the world, we can create a safe place for people like us, and from here, we can observe the world from a distance.",joy
As I have suspected. This meeting is futile.,anger
"I do not wish to join hands with people who do not share the same beliefs. Besides, I already have a land to rule.",anger
"Please, Ryo. May we talk?",sadness
Farewell. I hope we do not see each other again.,anger
"That did not go well, Chief.",sadness
"We should go back as well, Chief.",fear
It is not safe here.,fear
Let's go home.,anger
I hate real winter.,anger
"Hey, careful!",fear
You'll slip!,fear
T-Thank y-you.,joy
How's the Huntres tribe doing? I heard there are groups of agitators on the rise again.,fear
You three are late.,anger
"Still the nosy outsider, aren't you?",anger
"Given that my tribe is an intelligence agency, don't you think it'll be stranger if I don't know?",anger
"Rainie smiled. ""Oh, he is, though I'm starting to take over some of his works.""",joy
"""Good,"" Krystal commented. This summit will not be official if everyone isn't a leader.",joy
Hatred is something that cannot be quelled easily. I am sure we all know that.,anger
"""But I hope we can pave the path toward that dream,"" at least, Rainie continued.",sadness
"Everyone fell silent for a few seconds, but Nel's laugh broke the tension. Despite being the youngest and quite a timid one, you have a way with words.",joy
"""I cannot wait for you to be the leader. You're definitely more mature than this one,""",joy
"""Just say you are short-tempered,"" Nel retorted.",joy
A smile escaped her lips upon seeing the three.,joy
