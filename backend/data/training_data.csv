“Okay lang ako! Ano ba kayo?”,Anger
“Your tibialis anterior is damaged.”,Fear
"“Ha? Saan ‘yun? Ay basta, ayos lang ako. Habulin na lang natin ‘yung kriminal at baka makatakas siya!”",Anger
"“Sadly, he’s in the West.”",Sadness
"“Tsk. Kailangan kong magtago. Alam na ng mga pulis na ako ang pumatay sa hayup na ‘yun,”",Fear
Yeah. These were the same cards she used as weapons. After gamitin ng Mama ni Hiro and cards  ay binigay niya ‘yun sa akin since Mama ko ang nagmamay-ari nun. Ito na lang ang  remembrance ko sa kanya dahil...dahil...wala na rin si Demi na pusa niya.,Sadness
‘Don’t think about it.’,Sadness
"Kahit mag-iisang taon na simula nung nangyari ‘yung war, fresh pa rin sa isip ko lahat ng  nangyari. Lagi kong sinisisi ang sarili ko dahil sa pagkamatay ni Demi at dahil napakahina ko noon.",Sadness
"“Still thinking about it, nee-san?”",Sadness
“Sa hill na naman?” sabay ngiti sa akin ni Akane.,Joy
"Huminga naman ako nang malalim para pigilan ‘yung luha ko. Hanggang ngayon, nagsisisi pa  rin ako sa nangyari. Nang matapos ang war, gabi-gabi kong napapanaginipan si Demi. Kahit naalam kong magkasama na sila ni Mama ngayon, nalulungkot pa rin ako.",Sadness
Ito na nga ba ang  tamang panahon para sa balak namin? Natatakot ako sa pwedeng mangyari pero ito ang dapat  naming gawin.,Fear
“Wala lang. Nag-iisip-isip. Ikaw?”,Sadness
“Don’t worry. Kaya niya ang sarili niya. She’s one of the Great Seven.”,Joy
"Kahit sinabi ko ‘yun ay nag-aalala rin ako para kay Mama, at alam kong ganun din si Hiro.  Protective siya pagdating sa Mama niya. Siguro dahil natatakot siyang mawala o malayo ulit sa  kanya. Ganun din kasi ako kay Papa. Kahit na siya ang pinakamalakas sa amin ay natatakot pa  rin ako kapag umaalis siya. Natatakot ako na baka kung anong mangyari sa kanya.",Fear
“Sorry.”,Sadness
"“Not really. Share sila ni Dad. Maybe she just want to brag,”",Joy
“Yes. I remember what most people want to forget.”,Sadness
Bigla akong naawa sa kanya at kahit madilim ay kita ko ang lungkot sa mukha niya.,Sadness
“Just fill your mind with happy and positive thoughts.”,Joy
"“Thanks,” tapos kinuha niya ‘yung flower.",Joy
"“Kung hindi ‘to alam ni Sir Hideo, illegal ‘to. Tatakas tayo? Pero baka makita niya tayo.”",Fear
Wow ha. Naisip ni Darwin ‘yun?”,Joy
“bakit kasi umaga ang PE class natin? Sino bang sira ang tuktok ang nagsuggest nito?”,Anger
"“Utak talaga nun, may switch. Minsan on, madalas off.”",Anger
"Natawa naman ako sa sinabi niya hanggang sa umabot na ang pang-aasar niya kay Ken sa  pagkatao niya. Kapag nag-aaway sila, gumagaan lagi ang atmosphere. Kaya siguro super naging  close ako sa kanila nitong nagdaang taon dahil kapag kasama ko sila, nakakalimutan ko ‘yung  mga masasamang nangyari.",Joy
"“Anong ginagawa mo? Ang creepy, Akane.” ",Fear
"“Hmm, 115 bpm. Definitely excited,”",Joy
“Pfft. Nakakatawa ‘yung reaksyon mo kanina!”,Joy
“Pano nakakatakot ‘yang itsura mo. Masyadong seryoso.” ,Fear
“Hoy Ken!” sabay batok niya kay Ken.,Anger
“Aray! Problema mo?! Sakit nun ha! Ginulo mo pa buhok ko!”,Anger
“Magulo naman talaga buhok mo! Bakit ba kasi 6 AM ang nirequest mong class sa PE ha? May sira na ba ‘yang utak mo?” ,Anger
“It’s a good book. Kumpleto rin ‘yung illustrations.”,Joy
“Talaga? Thank you.”,Joy
Pinanood ko lang silang dalawa habang nag-uusap at napangiti ako.,Joy
"“Mmm. Nadiscover niya pa ngang nasa gitna ang Yllka Shrine ng major bases ng bawat tribes.  Though, mukhang ikaw ay alam mo na kaagad.”",Joy
“Hindi niyo ako matatakasan.”,Anger
Nagsitayuan ang mga balahibo ko nung biglang may bumulong sa tenga ko.,Fear
"Aatakihin ako sa puso ng wala sa oras dahil kay Ma’am Michiko eh. Pero ang  nakakainis, ako lang ang nagulat.",Anger
“Sorry. Mali ‘yung trajectory ng arrow ko.”,Sadness
“It’s just a joke.”,Joy
“Nagjojoke na si Hiro! Anong gagawin natin?!”,Joy
Nagtawanan lang kami doon at kahit papaano ay gumaan ulit ang atmosphere.,Joy
"Nakatayo sa likuran ni Hiro sina Ma’am Reina, Sir Hayate at Sir Hiroshi. Hindi ko alam na  umuwi pala sila rito. Ngayon ko na lang ulit sila nakita!",Joy
"“Talaga po, Sir?”",Joy
At nung nagtakeoff kami ay pinangako ko sa sarili ko na hinding-hindi na ako sasakay dito.,Fear
"Glad you're awake,",Joy
After a few minutes ay nawala na 'yung bigat ng sikmura ko at medyo umayos ang pakiramdam  ko. Effective nga 'yung gamot. Sino kaya ang gumawa nun? Si Reiji? Si Riye? At paano kaya  nila nagawa 'yun?,Joy
"""Teka, Sir. Hindi ba tayo mahuhuli nito dahil pumasok tayo sa Romania ng walang pasabi?"" tanong ni Akane habang nakasilip pa sa bintana at palakad-lakad.",Fear
"lumabas sa aming tatlo. Sa wakas, nakaalis din! Huminga ako nang malalim at sobrang fresh ng  hangin dito pero sobrang lamig din.",Joy
"""Akemi, don't go that way,""",Fear
"""May naririnig akong wild animals. I think may wild bears at boars sa area na 'yun. ",Fear
"""S-siguro naman mechanism 'yan ng kweba no?"" tanong ko sa kanila.",Fear
M-mukha nga. Hindi naman siguro tayo matatrap dito.,Fear
"""Whoa...paanong...""",Joy
"""This place represents the different attributes of our tribe.""",Joy
"""Oh. Nice place. Hindi ko akalaing may nag-eexist na ganito.""",Joy
"""You're all here.""",Joy
"It's nice to see you again, Rainie.'",Joy
Kahit na civil kami sa isa't  isa ngayon ay may doubt pa rin kami sa kahihinatnan ng meeting na 'to.,Fear
"""Sure. It's better to be smart than only relying on brute strength."" Bigla namang tumingin si Nel  kay Krystal at alam kong anytime ay may mangyayari nang masama dahil bigla ulit tumaas ang  tension sa paligid.",Fear
"""Are you implying something?"" ",Anger
Uh oh. I smell trouble.,Fear
"naririnig. Maging ang balat ko ay nararamdaman ang tension dahil tumaas ang mga balahibo ko  at nabalutan ng goose bumps. Pati sina Akane, Hiro at 'yung mga kasama nina Darwin, Krystal at  Nel ay naging alert din.",Fear
"Well, I guess we still don't trust each other,",Anger
I was slightly shaking because I instinctively aimed my arrowed-bullet gun to Darwin since I felt that pressure in his direction.,Fear
Well said. You made your point very well.',Joy
Did I sound rude?' ,Fear
No. You sound like your dad—a leader.',Joy
Napangiti naman ako at nabawasan ang burden sa loob ko dahil doon.,Joy
Ayoko kasing lumabas na  rude at sabihing nagmamarunong ako dahil sa mga nasabi ko.,Fear
"""She's having a  hard time these past few days. Sa inyo tuloy nabubuhos,""",Sadness
"""We should. Baka biglang magbago na naman ang mood ng iba,""",Fear
"Nagamit ko na ang  Black Dimension ng ilang beses these past few months kahit hindi ko pa masyadong kontrolado  ang pagbukas at sara nun pero masasabi ko na sobrang mapanganib doon ngayon. That place is  too quiet that I tend to hear a lot of buzzing and humming, plus the tension in the surrounding is  too high. Pakiramdam ko ay laging may nakatingin sa akin kapag nandoon ako kaya nga hangga't  maaari ay hindi muna ako nagtatravel doon kung hindi naman kailangan.",Fear
Of course. Her team succesfully infiltrated the shinigami's base and retreived her comrades'eyes.,Joy
"""They're fine. Sa katunayan, mas maraming Shinigamis ang sumali sa amin nung nalaman nilang  buhay pa sila at sila ang naglelead. I guess my parents' reputation are good back then.""",Joy
"""That's great.""",Joy
"""Yes. Ayos na. I was devastated for the first few months after the war.Pero nakapagmove on na rin naman ako at marami na akong natutunan ngayon kaya ayos na ako.""",Joy
"""I see. I guess there's no need to worry about you.""",Joy
"""Thanks for this, by the way. It warms me up since we're living on a cold place.""",Joy
"""Sige, mauna na kami. It's nice seeing you again, Rainie."" ",Joy
"""Okay lang 'no. 'Di ba naging classmate mo siya dati bago kayo ma-involve sa mundo ng Erityians kaya alam naming nagcacatch-up kayo sa isa't isa. 'Di ba, Hiro?""",Joy
"""Shit, hindi ko alam kung paano maglaland!""",Fear
"""Uhm, I think pipindutin ang button na 'to while pulling down the lever.""",Fear
"""Yo-yo ka dyan! What the heck are you guys doing here?!""",Anger
"""Nice. I didn't even notice it,""",Joy
"""Ang sakit nun ha!""",Anger
Bigla  akong kinabahan dahil baka nalaman ni Papa ang nangyaring secret meeting sa pagitan ng apat  na tribes kaya niya kami pinapatawag. Baka nagalit siya dahil hindi namin sinabi or hindi man  lang kami nag-consult sa kanya.,Fear
"""They're here,"" sabi ni Papa at ngumiti naman ang kasama niya.",Joy
"""Yes. You're going with me.""",Joy
"""That it's dangerous. She's worried about us.""",Fear
"""Do you sense that presence, too?""",Fear
"After all, dahil sa mga  Shinigami kung bakit nawala ang apat sa Great Seven, kasama ang asawa niya pati na si Mama.  Alam kong masakit pa rin para sa kanya lahat ng nangyari kahit ilang taon na ang nakalipas,  ganun din para kay Papa at kay Ma'am Michiko.",Sadness
Napangiti naman ako habang tinitignan ko siyang maglagay ng contacts.,Joy
Napatingin din ako sa paligid at may naramdaman akong kakaiba. I scanned the people around  us and I saw several suspicious-looking persons observing us.,Fear
"""Mauna na kayo. I'll just clean this mess. You know where it is, right?""",Anger
Napatingin din ako sa kalapit na building kung nasaan ang isa pang nagmamanman sa amin at  nakita kong sinusundan niya pa rin kami ng tingin.,Fear
Napasandal na lang ako at huminga nang malalim.,Fear
"""Do you sense that presence, too?""",Fear
"Oo. Pero hindi ko alam kung saan nanggagaling. I can't locate him or her,",Fear
'He built a miniature plane before and they named it Kaoru. Mukhang nagawa na niya talaga ang project na 'yun.',Joy
"""Don't let go,"" Hiro said. And the next thing I knew, the Black Dimension was already closing  and I saw the pain in his expression.",Fear
"Naramdaman ko rin ang lalong paghigpit ng braso ng Shinigami sa  leeg ko, to the point na hindi na ako makahinga.",Fear
"H-Hiro... I tapped his face but he's not responding. ""Don't you dare die on me. Hiro...please, gumising ka.""",Fear
"""Please...""",Fear
I'm sorry.,Sadness
Sobrang natakot ako sa nangyari sa kanya. Nung nakita ko siyang unti-unting nawawalan ng malay kanina ay parang bagyong pumasok ulit sa isip ko lahat ng nangyari noong war. The deaths of the people I knew flashed on my mind…  ...especially Demi's.,Sadness
"Natakot akong may mawawala na namang importante sa akin. I've already lost my mother, my  friend, comrades and teachers. I don't want to lose someone anymore.",Sadness
"""You did protect me,""",Joy
"""You almost died.""",Fear
"""But I'm still alive."" Bumitiw siya at hinarap niya ako sa kanya. ""And it's because of you. So don't say you're weak because you're not.""",Joy
"""I think we ended up at the place we're looking for,""",Fear
"""Anong gagawin natin?""",Fear
"""Let's keep an eye on the surroundings from here first. We need to wait for them before doing something. They're coming, right?"" Tumango naman ako as a confirmation.",Fear
 Bigla naman akong may naramdamang presence na papalapit sa amin kaya naging alert ang isip  at katawan ko.,Fear
"""What did you do? Two of your fatal points are in dire state.""",Fear
"""No. Those are called fatal points for a reason. Pwede kang mamatay kapag lumala pa ang injury mo.""",Fear
"""Dahil nalaman nilang nandito sa Japan si Naomi at Rainie. Of course, as one of the Great Seven,  they want to take her down,"" sagot ni Darwin.",Fear
"""Wait, bakit pati ako?"" Naintindihan ko 'yung part about Hiro's mom pero bakit na naman nila  ako kailangan? Dahil pa rin ba sa kadahilanang ako ang anak ni Rielle/Akemi?",Fear
"""N-no way. My eyes are not that...""",Fear
"""He's right,"" dagdag naman ni Hiro. ""Plus your eyes have different shades of green. It's peculiar.""",Fear
Gusto kong sumunod sa kanila pero baka maging  pabigat lang ako sa kanila dahil sa injury ko.,Sadness
They are in trouble.,Fear
"""Ako ang kailangan ninyo, hindi ba?!""",Anger
Napangiti ako dahil sinunod nila ako at mas minabuti nilang ituloy ang plano.,Joy
Napatingin naman ako sa lalaking inatake ko. He's not moving anymore.,Joy
"""Take me, if you can,"" malakas kong sabi at kinilabutan ako nung naramdaman ko ang sabay sabay na pagbukas ng ilang parts ng Black Dimension.",Fear
I smiled triumphantly.  I fulfilled my role.,Joy
 But I don't think I can last any longer because all of them lunged at me.,Sadness
These Shinigamis are going to kill me.,Fear
"Hindi ba, Mama?",Joy
"""Ako na muna ang bahala sa kanila,""",Anger
"""This'll temporarily numb the pain but you should not do anything reckless anymore. Got that?""  then after that, may cold sensation akong naramdaman na pumasok sa balat ko. It stung at first  but after some time, the searing and throbbing pain subsided.",Joy
 Para akong nabunutan ng tinik nung hindi ko na masyadong maramdaman ang sakit ng balikat at  braso ko.,Joy
"Naramdaman ko naman bigla ang tuluy-tuloy na pagbukas at pagsara ng Black Dimension sa  paligid namin at isa lang ang ibig sabihin nun--they are sending reinforcements and they really  know we're here. They must have known our plans, too.",Fear
" ""Man, our plan is now messed up!"" sabay upo ni Nel sa kaliwa ko at sumunod naman si Krystal sa kanya.",Fear
" ""Oh. A cute eyeglasses-wearing guy helped us,""",Joy
"Napatigil naman ako sa pag-iisip nung naramdaman ko na naman ang pagbukas ng Black  Dimension, and this time, kinilabutan ako dahil sobrang laking parte ang unti-unting bumubukas.",Fear
What the hell is this creepy feeling?,Fear
"""So you are really here, kid. Rielle's daughter.""",Joy
"""One more word and I'll behead you.""",Anger
"""If you could, old hag.""",Anger
" ""You're going with us, whether you like it or not.""",Anger
"""Hindi ako sasama sa inyo kahit ano pang gawin n'yo. I'd rather die than being in your hands.""",Anger
"""Then die,",Anger
"""You really look like her,"" sabi naman nung lalaking katabi niya and for a second ay akala ko si  Darwin ang nakatingin sa akin. He must be his father.",Joy
"""It's been a long time, Izumi, Kurai.""",joy
I have a bad feeling about this.,Fear
"""I should have done this years ago,"" sabi naman ni Papa at kahit hindi ko nakikita ang expression niya ay naramdaman ko ang sakit sa bawat salitang binitiwan niya.",Sadness
"""Go all out. Erase this place where she suffered a lot.""",Anger
"""That's my plan from the very start,""",Anger
"""Hey! Where are you going?!""",Fear
"""Chase him!""",Anger
"""Heh. So ikaw ang anak ng traydor na 'yun?""",Anger
Ako nga. I am the daughter of Rielle. Do you have any problems with that?,Anger
"I really find it frustrating when they label her as a traitor. Hindi siya tanggap ng Senshins at hindi  rin siya kinikilala ng Shinigamis. Kung ako nga ay nasasaktan para sa kanya ngayon, gaano pa  kaya kasakit ang naramdaman niya noon?",Sadness
Gusto kong masaktan at umiyak para sa kanya pero alam kong ayaw niya 'yung mangyari. It's  exasperating but I know her hardships were for me.,Sadness
"""I won't let you touch him,""",Anger
"That's my girl. Kidding,'",Joy
"""Are you okay?"" tanong ni Darwin nung makalapit na siya sa akin.",Fear
"""Y-Yeah. By the way, nasaan si Hiro?""",Fear
"""This system is complicated. Kapag nagkamali tayo ng password, mala-lock lahat ng files dito at hindi na natin mabubuksan kahit anong mangyari.""",Fear
"""So that means we only have one chance.""",Fear
"""Eyes can be me or shishen but—"" Pagkasabi ko nun ay nagkatinginan kami bigla at alam kong  halos pareho kami ng naisip. This 8-letter word password might be a wordplay. If that's the case, then…",Joy
"Kailangan na nating umalis dito,",Fear
The Shinigamis surrounding us were wiped out instantly.,Joy
"As I was looking at my father taking down the building, I felt a sense of relief and sadness.  Seeing his actions, I know that he wanted to do this after all this time. He wanted to erase this  place where my mother suffered.",Sadness
Nakatingin lang ako sa chip. Natatakot ako sa maaari kong malaman base sa data na nakalap  namin ni Darwin pero gusto kong makilala si Mama.,Fear
"""Yeah. I'm scared to know the truth.""",Fear
"""Y-your arm!"" sigaw ko at halos isigaw ko ang pangalan ni Riye pero narealize kong kaming dalawa lang ang nandito ngayon.",Fear
"""Sorry, Rainie. Sorry if I can't say anything about your mother.""",Sadness
"""To our ancestor, Ryou!"" sigaw nila habang nakataas ang mga sandata. ""Let this victory mark the  start of another era! Shinigamis!""",Joy
Bigla tuloy akong naguilty dahil hindi ko man lang ulit sila nakita para makapagpasalamat. They  are the reason why I survived the fight. If it weren't for them…,Sadness
Tinanggal ko ang kamay ko sa mga mata niya at napangiti ako nung nakita kong   natutulog na siya.,Joy
Inuna kong tignan ang pictures na nakalagay doon at halos  sumikip ang dibdib ko habang ginagawa ko 'yun.,Sadness
Nararamdaman ko ang hirap  at sakit na dinanas niya. Alam kong sobrang hirap ng pinagdaanan niya base sa mga kwentong  naririnig ko pero ngayong nakikita ko ang nangyari ay mas malala pa pala 'to kaysa sa iniisip ko.,Sadness
"""Please, let me hold her for the first and last time,""",Sadness
"""Is that your last wish?"" Tumango si Mama. ""I'll give you fifteen seconds. Cherish it.""",Sadness
 Parang lumubog ang puso ko nung narinig ko 'yun.,Sadness
 Nakatingin lang ako sa paanan ko dahil feeling ko ay maiiyak lang ulit ako kapag hinarap ko siya,Sadness
Hindi ko pa kayang basahin ang iba pang files na nakalagay doon dahil sobrang bigat na kaagad ng pakiramdam ko.,Sadness
"""Nakakamiss,"" bulong ko at tumango naman si Darwin.",Sadness
"""It's nice to see the both of you again,""",Joy
"""Sobrang isolated pala talaga natin dati,"" sabi ko sa kanya.",Joy
"""Thanks for keeping me company,"" sabi niya at saka siya ngumiti.",Joy
"""Nag-enjoy din naman ako so no worries."" ",Joy
"""You did the same, too. Kaya salamat din at ganun ang tingin mo sa akin.""",Joy
Dungeon. Sobrang sakit makita lahat ng 'yun. Sobrang sakit malaman lahat ng pinagdaanan niya para sa akin.,Sadness
Nandito ako ngayon sa harap ng puntod niya. Kanina pa ako nakaupo rito dahil gusto ko lang  siyang makasama ngayong araw. Gusto kong nasa tabi niya ako ngayon dahil alam kong ilang  buwan siyang naging mag-isa nung nasa tiyan niya pa lang ako. I want to return her love for me.,Sadness
Bigla namang tumulo ang luha ko habang inaalala ang lahat ng 'yun.,Sadness
"""I really admire you, Mama. You're so strong. And even if nobody's talking about you here  because they said you were a curse, you will always be my hero. It's just sad that you're not here anymore.""",Sadness
Pinunasan ko ang luha ko pero tuluy-tuloy pa rin silang tumutulo.,Sadness
Ang daming what-ifs ngayon sa isip ko. Ang dami kong gustong gawin kasama sina Mama at  Papa pero alam kong hinding-hindi na 'yun mangyayari kahit ano pang gawin ko.,Sadness
Hindi ko na napigilan ang sarili ko at napahagulgol na ako. Sobrang sakit para sa akin na hindi  man lang kami naging buo. Ni hindi man lang niya nakasama ang pamilya niya nang matagal.,Sadness
"Kung ganito na kasakit para sa akin, hindi ko maimagine kung gaano kasakit ang naramdaman during those times.",Sadness
She died in his arms.,Sadness
"I don't know, he said and I saw the sadness in his eyes. ""These past few months, I've been recollecting some unfamiliar memories.""",Sadness
"""There are memories inside my head that keeps on appearing even though I'm not that familiar  with them. It seems like I subconsciously pushed them away to the farthest place on my mind but  they're slowly coming back.""",Sadness
"""Memories when I was still a kid.""",Sadness
"""But remembering is just as worse as forgetting.""",Sadness
"""I was carried by someone. His whole body was bleeding and I can hear myself crying. I saw the President's face. The man holding me was saying something to him...""",Sadness
"""He said I should always protect Mom. For him.""",Sadness
"""Then I saw a dying woman."" I froze when I heard that. Halos lumubog ang puso ko dahil alam  ko kung sino ang tinutukoy niya. ""I can't remember all the things she said but she died smiling. I  remember being soaked in the rain in the arms of your father. His cries filled the place. After  that, my memories become hazy and I can't remember anything anymore.""",Sadness
"Napatingin ulit ako sa puntod ni Mama at hindi ko akalaing namatay siya nang nakangiti. Really,  how strong are you, Mama? I can't believe she managed to put a smile on her face after all the  sufferings she experienced. Then I realized, it must be because of my father. After all, they were  together until the end.",Sadness
"""Looking into your eyes made me feel better.""",Sadness
"""Our truce might be turning into an alliance, finally.""",Joy
"""Hindi po ako makatulog."" Automatic na tumulo ang luha ko pagkasabi ko nun at agad kong  tinago ang mukha ko sa hood ng cloak na suot ko pero naramdaman ko ang kamay niya sa ulo ko.",sadness
"""You don't need to hide your tears."" Napatingin ako sa kanya at nakita kong tahimik lang siyang lumuluha habang nakatingin sa puntod ni Mama.",Sadness
"""Your mother did this to me, too. You really have the same actions.""",Sadness
"""Wow. So binabantayan mo pala ang mga kilos niya, Papa.""",Joy
"""Pwede bang hayaan mo akong gawin 'to? I didn't have the chance to put you to sleep when you were still a child.""",Joy

A smile escaped my lips upon hearing that line.,Joy
"""I'm a Keeper,"" I said. ""I need to stay alive to keep my team from dying.""",Anger
The smile on my face faded as I marched away from the place that sheltered me since I was young.,Sadness
It's time to return to the place of curses and chaos.,Fear
It's time to go home.,Sadness
I had lost track of time as I drifted for days in the middle of the ocean.,Sadness
"Fortunately, my supplies were still enough and the ocean was calm.",Joy
Nel would surely be awake by now.,Fear
"I could imagine her angry face, questioning Cliff and Jett about me.",Sadness
A smile escaped my lips as I reminisced the life I had in CIA.,Sadness
It was never easy but it was less troubling than where I was headed.,Sadness
Shima had been a subject of myths and rumors among Erityians.,Sadness
"Many believed it was not real, until he met his demise.",Sadness
"I could still remember that time: Executioners were ready to slaughter every Shinigami they hadimprisoned, not minding the repercussions from the administration and the
council.",Anger
"Ise, then head of the Jikko clan, vowed to kill every single Shinigami who made his grandson suffer.",Anger
"""Naia, you should never allow anyone to read your mind,""",Fear
"""Why?""",Sadness
"""Because they can use your thoughts and memories against you.""",Fear
I heaved a sigh.,Sadness
It's been more than a decade since he died yet the pain still lingered inside me.,Sadness
I missed him.,Sadness
My thoughts returned to the present when the clear sky and water suddenly turned dark.,Sadness
"In a span of a few seconds, everything was already covered in fog.",Fear
A wave of nostalgia hit me as I felt the fog brushed against my skin.,Sadness
"""Farallon,"" I called.",Fear
"As if on cue, the fog dissipated and the familiar island came into view.",Joy
The silence I was enjoying a while ago was replaced by cries and screams of agony and pain.,Sadness
The air was filled with metallic and putrid smell—the scent of bloodshed and death.,Fear
"""Is that you, Naia?"" a voice echoed.",Fear
"I smirked. ""Yeah. I thought you've already forgotten me.""",Joy
A guy clad in black holding a huge scythe appeared in front of me. He still looked the same except for the additional creases on his face.,Fear
"Farallon was never fazed with anything. Even when Vince brought her here, he remained inexpressive.",Fear
"When Vince died, his face was expressionless but his eyes were gleaming with wrath.",Sadness
Seeing him after a long time made me feel like I was a kid again.,Joy
"""How's everyone?"" I asked as I came ashore.",Joy
"""Why are you here?"" he questioned without answering mine.",Anger
"""I have a special delivery",Joy
"Despite his skepticism, he walked with me toward the forest.",Fear
"I heard the familiar roars of Shira and Hyora, the guardians and first line of defense of this island.",Joy
"""Hey,"" I snickered as the lion and leopard made their way to me.",Joy
"""Missed me, buddies?""",Joy
I didn't have any friends of my age in this place and all the Executioners were busy with their jobs and missions so I befriended these two.,Sadness
"Among the natives of this island, only me and Aristus could snuggle with these deadly predators.",Joy
"""Everything has changed here,"" Farallon said as we passed through the forest.",Sadness
It was always dark in the woods as the canopy of trees blocked the sunlight.,Sadness
I remembered getting lost here when I was young and Farallon found me in a critical state.,Sadness
My arms accidentally brushed against the leaves of a poisonous plant and rendered me motionless.,sadness
The venomous insects buzzed around and the deadly plants' leaves fluttered in the wind.,Fear
It took us a while to get out of the forest and the stretch of sludge came into view.,Joy
"Farallon wounded himself, his blood trickling from his finger and it dropped onto the boulder at the forest's threshold.",Fear
"The path of stone emerged, bridging the gap between the forest and the village.",Joy
The rancid smell was enough to make someone nauseous but it was already normal for the inhabitants of this island.,Fear
"When we reached the end of the path, the stones sank back into the sludge and we marched forward.",Fear
"Some Executioners halted, others took a glance at me, as I walked beside Farallon.",Fear
The older ones were able to recognize me as the child who had red eyes.,Fear
"""Naia?"" One of the called. ""Is that you, Naia?""",Joy
"""Yuma,"" I replied. ""You look old now.""",Sadness
He drew his sword and I swiftly fended off his attack.,Fear
"Some Executioners gathered around, bellowing and cheering, as the two of us were caught in an onslaught.",Anger
"He was still fast and agile despite his age. I could feel the cuts on my skin, blood streaming through my arms.",Sadness
I managed to land a gash on his cheeks and he looked more excited.,Anger
"""Damn, child, you better not underestimate me,"" he beamed as he charged at me.",Anger
"That moment, my skin tingled as I felt an intense bloodlust from him.",Fear
"""The unprepared are the first to die.""",Sadness
I remembered what I told to Jett and cursed myself for being too softhearted.,Sadness
"This was Shima, a place where comrades could kill one another without giving a thought.",Fear
"He disappeared from my sight, and the next thing I knew, the tip of his blade was already piercing through my right shoulder.",Anger
I gritted my teeth in pain and held his sword.,Anger
I kicked his neck as I my hands bled while gripping his blade.,Anger
The force made him lose his balance and grip on the sword and I immediately pulled it out of my flesh.,Fear
Yuma sat up and laughed hysterically as he looked at me.,Anger
"""Shit, this is bad,"" he chuckled. ""I want to kill you now.""",Anger
He was ready to charged at me but everyone suddenly fell silent.,Fear
"I felt the immense pressure in the atmosphere, making my body tremble in fear.",Fear
"""W-what was that?"" I mumbled.",Fear
"Amidst the silence, I heard heavy footsteps approaching our direction",Fear
The Executioners gave way and I saw a hooded man walking toward us.,Fear
The tattered cloak fluttered as the wind howled.,Sadness
Behind him was a woman who was eerily familiar. Then I remembered Nel's story about a Senshin who had the eyes of a Shinigami and a Custos.,Fear
"The Executioners, as well as Yuma and Farallon, bowed to him and that got me confused.",Sadness
"As far as I remembered, Lionel should be the de-facto leader since Ise lost his only heir when Vince died.",Sadness
I was sure Lionel didn't look like that when I left Shima.,Fear
"""Child, state your name,"" he demanded and I flinched upon hearing his voice.",Fear
"""N-Naia,"" I answered.",Fear
"""I see. The child of Diona and Heron,"" he said and my stomach churned in distress as I heard my parents' names.",Anger
He carefully removed his hood and I almost got paralyzed by his stare.,Fear
Intense and cold green eyes looked right into mine.,Anger
"""W-who are you?"" I asked, my voice shaking in fear.",Fear
He bellowed in laughter as if my question was something funny.,Sadness
"""A Jikko branch clan member,"" he responded.",Sadness
"""That old fart didn't even talk to me until he needed someone to inherit his position.""",Sadness
Some Executioners were visibly uncomfortable after hearing him badmouthing Ise.,Fear
"I, too, felt annoyed as Ise was the most respectable person in this island.",Anger
"""I vowed to hunt down every single Shinigami but they locked me up in this place,"" he seethed and I had to step back because his anger screamed danger.",Anger
"""Damn that council of old and coward shitheads.""",Anger
"""Dad, calm down,"" the woman behind him softly said.",Sadness
The man looked at me again after he calmed down.,Joy
"""I am Kyo,"" he said, ""the strongest Executioner, and this is now my turf.""",Joy
It had been three hours since I arrived in Shima yet I had already learned about what happened here after Ise and Vince died.,Sadness
"Shira snuggled me and I could hear the guttural sound he was making, as if asking some attention.",Fear
"""Man, you haven't change at all,"" I snickered while caressing his mane.",Joy
I stayed at the shore of the island as they decide what to do with me and the prisoners I had to transfer using the Senshins and Custos technology.,Fear
"Heaving a sigh, I stared at the endless sea.",Sadness
I still couldn't believe that guy had been the leader the moment he arrived here. And to think that girl who had the eyes of different tribe was his daughter.,Fear
I reached for my weapon as I turned my head around and saw that girl. Speaking of the devil.,Fear
She walked toward my direction and Shira started snarling at her.,Anger
"""Calm down, boy,"" I said.",Anger
"""Go play with Hyora.""",Fear
The girl sat beside me and looked at the gray sky.,Sadness
She smiled and it felt so genuine that I let my guard down for a second,Joy
"""You know, when I first arrived here, I thought I was going to die.",Fear
"This time, for real,"" she chuckled.",Sadness
"""I, too, was bringing criminals from the Nox and Sir Hideo told me that I should brace myself when I set foot here.",Fear
"I thought it was because of this island's reputation.""",Sadness
She glanced at me and her eyes were so distracting.,Sadness
Her iridescent irises where beautiful and nauseating at the same time.,Anger
I wonder what it felt to have eyes of different tribes and abilities.,Joy
"""I was attacked by the Executioners the moment I landed.",Sadness
"I was a fighter, too, but their strength were on a different level.",Fear
It felt like I was fighting a Huntres with an instinct of a Senshin.,Fear
"It was terrifying.""",Fear
My lips curved upward. Hearing that compliment for the Jikko clan was uplifting.,Joy
"""My plan was to leave the criminals, deliver a news, and go back to Tantei High, but everything changed when their 'leader' came to meet me.""",Fear
"""It must be shocking,"" I commented.",Fear
"My Dad is strong and stubborn so deep in my heart, I knew he was still alive, despite being labeled as missing in the records of the Senshins.""",Sadness
"The only ones we were told to be wary about in the Senshin tribe were the remnants of the Great Seven, and some of the professors.",Fear
"""But I didn't expect to see him here. Dad never liked positions.""",Anger
"""Well, he's still a Jikko,"" I said. ""And when . . . when Vince died, the main family had no heir to replace him as the future leader.""",Sadness
"""Ah. So you didn't know.""",Sadness
"I glanced at her, my brows furrowed, unsure if I heard that right.",Sadness
"""Huh? What do you mean?""",Fear
"""Alternative name?""",Sadness
"She nodded. ""Yup. And do you know Naomi?""",Sadness
"""Naomi?""",Joy
That name triggered a certain memory. I remembered the woman Vince brought here when she returned for a while. It was just a brief time but she was the first 'friend' I had.,Sadness
I stifled a gasp upon hearing that. Vince and Nathalie? They . . . they had a child?,Joy
"""Where are the criminals you are talking about?"" he asked, but it sounded like a demand.",Anger
Maintaining my composure was difficult in front of this Kyo.,Fear
His presence was enough to feel his superiority and strength.,Fear
"""Heh. I see. That smart-ass is still developing handy inventions.""",Anger
"""Should we go to Keimusho-rei first so that they can be easily imprisoned?""",Sadness
"He scoffed. ""No. They need to stand trial.""",Anger
There were still pools of blood on the ground and vultures were quietly looming above us.,Sadness
"""Who's going to be tortured?""",Anger
"""Most probably, the criminals I brought.""",Sadness
"The look on their faces was a mixture of nausea, confusion and anger",Fear
"Despite their feet and hands being bound, few of them started attacking the people around . . . which was a wrong and dumb move.",Anger
"""This one's mine!""",Anger
"""Humdrums are, indeed, stupid.""",Anger
"""Couple of Erityians, too.""",Anger
"""How does that feel?""",Sadness
"""Your members are being toyed by an 11-year old Jikko.""",Anger
"""A traitor like you,"" Yuma said as the tip of his scythe digging through Eerie's skin, ""brings shame to the Senshin tribe.""",Anger
"""Yuma. Stop.""",Anger
"My skin crawled upon hearing that familiar voice and when I turned around, I saw Lionel walking toward our direction.",Fear
"""I have finished cleaning the Rei level,"" he reported to Kyo.",Joy
"""Good,"" Kyo responded and Lionel went to the Nox's direction. ""Reliable as ever,"" he commented.",Joy
"""Of course,"" I said.",Joy
"""You're right,"" he chuckled. ""But potential-wise, that brat is higher than him.""",Anger
"""That brat?""",Anger
I shuddered when I felt his presence getting stronger and I had to step back to not get overwhelmed,Fear
"When I looked at him, his grin was nowhere to be found and it was replaced with a grim expression.",Sadness
"""Their leader, where is he?""",Sadness
"""He escaped,"" I replied. ""We're currently monitoring his movements.""",Sadness
"""I see. We can help.""",Joy
"""How?""",Fear
"""Okay. I'll be counting on you.""",Joy
He silently walked away and I was left alone.,Sadness
I wanted to contact the CIA but communication outside was forbidden in this island.,Sadness
My range had improved and I could now hear the cries and howls in the prisons.,Sadness
I suddenly remembered how Nathalie almost lost her memories before because of these voices.,Sadness
That must be really scary.,Fear
'How did you know my name?',Joy
"Hearing a voice inside my head, which was neither a scream of pain nor cries from mind torture, made me flinch. Who . . . wait . . .",Sadness
'N-Nathalie?',Fear
'Who are you?',Fear
"""Hey, I heard her,"" I said while catching my breath.",Fear
"""Ah. So you knew.""",Joy
"""She's here?""",Joy
"Nathalie looked at my direction, a hint of surprise on her face, but after a few seconds, she smiled, as if she had finally recognized me.",Joy
"""Naia?"" she called.",Joy
Then my eyes drifted to the guy beside him and I halted when I saw his face.,Fear
"""This pisses me off,"" Kyo grumbled",Anger
"Nathalie chuckled. ""I know what you mean, Sir Kyo. Well, Hideo raised him so he kinda got his personality.""",Sadness
"""You kid,"" he said while looking at the guy.",Anger
"""His name is Nathan,"" Nathalie said.",Fear
"""I don't need his real name. What's your alt—""",Anger
"""Hiro,"" the guy suddenly answered, cutting him off. ""Sir.""",Anger
Wow. He's got guts. I'll give him that.,Anger
"""Things to do?""",Anger
Kyo grinned as if he just found someone to toy with.,Joy
"""As the rightful heir to this damned island.""",Sadness
Kiyoko went to the prison with Lionel to transfer the captives they just tortured.,Sadness
'Too much noise.',Fear
"""You probably should not stay here,""",Fear
"""Seems like you have the same ability as Nathalie.""",Sadness
"""What do you mean?""",Anger
I remembered that time Nathalie almost lost her mind.,Sadness
"""You can hear inner voices despite their closed minds, right?"" He nodded.",Sadness
"""You sure you can handle the agony and pain of the tortured?",Fear
The heinous and brutal thoughts of the prisoners?,Fear
"The radical ways and thoughts of the executioners?""",Fear
He winced before he could answer my questions. I knew it. Those voices must be causing a discomfort and pain on his mind.,Fear
"""I can,"" he said.",Sadness
I wasn't sure if he was confident or just foolish.,Fear
"Amid the silence, I could hear faint voices, screams of agony and desperation from the prisoners.",Sadness
I remembered Kyo's words a while ago and might as well use this time to see what this guy could do.,Sadness
"Shock and confusion came into his face, and he leapt back, avoiding a serious cut on his neck.",Fear
"""Seems like your flight instincts have been honed,""",Joy
I remarked as blood trickled from his neck.,Fear
"""But, kiddo, Jikkos are known for fighting, not evading.",Sadness
"I guess you aren't ready to inherit that name yet.""",Sadness
"""Kiddo? You seem like just a few years older than me,"" he commented.",Anger
"""I call everyone weaker than me a kiddo,"" I retorted, and somehow it felt good.",Joy
"Before his hand could reach for something behind him, I lunged at him and gripped his arm.",Anger
I felt its tip on the back of my head but he grunted and lost his balance when I headbutted him.,Anger
"I snatched his gun as he fell on his back and pointed it at him. I fired two bullets on each side of his head, just a few inches from his ears.",Anger
"""What?",Anger
"Did you life flash right before your eyes?""",Anger
"""Oh, poor guy. A gun won't work against someone who lives in this island.",Sadness
""" A smile escaped my lips as I remembered how they described Vince's death. ",Sadness
"""They'd rather die than lose.""",Sadness
"""What are you doing?""",Anger
"I felt an intense pressure behind us and when I turned around, Kyo and Nathalie was already walking toward our direction.",Fear
"""Just testing his skills,"" I said.",Fear
"""Heh. And what's your assessment?""",Anger
"""He'd lose to Karim,"" I replied.",Sadness
"""Too slow. Too weak. Too emotional. Too self-centered. If I'm an Executioner, I won't offer my trust and loyalty to someone who can't even defend himself.""",Sadness
"""No filters and sugarcoating, huh? I like that,"" Kyo commented.",Joy
"""I don't like toning down my words. A weak must know he's weak, otherwise, he'd be complacent.""",Fear
"""Naia . . ."" Nathalie called, a look of worry flashed on her face.",Sadness
"""I'm sorry, Nathalie. I'm just saying the truth.",Sadness
"Well then, I need to rest.""",Sadness
My words might be harsh but this place is harsher.,Anger
"If it was the other Executioners that challenged him, he'd be dead by now.",Anger
He should have prepared himself before setting foot here.,Anger
"""Aristus!"" I called as I ran toward his direction.",Joy
"He smiled upon seeing me. ""Naia.""",Joy
"""I just learned that you're here,"" he softly said. ""And also Nathalie . . . and his son.""",Joy
"""I arrived yesterday and you just heard it today?""",Sadness
"""How many days did you spend inside your cave this time?""",Anger
"He chuckled nervously. ""Uh, a week, I think?""",Fear
"""Geek,"" I muttered.",Anger
"""Learning and writing our history is fun. You should try it,"" he remarked as his eyes twinkled in excitement.",Joy
"Aristus is the weakest here in terms of physical abilities, but the Executioners respect his vast knowledge about our race.",Joy
"""Ah. By the way, have they extracted information from the Nox members?"" I asked.",Fear
"Aristus smirked and glanced at the isolated part of the island, which was called blood chamber, because of the red-dyed ground due to the volcano and keimusho.",Joy
"""You know how Lionel works,"" he said.",Anger
"""Still as persuasive as ever, huh?""",Anger
Nathalie and Hiro would probably lose their minds the moment they stepped into this chamber.,Sadness
How could he still look comfortable with that mantle covering his body? Damn monster.,Anger
"""You sure you can handle this?"" Aristus asked.",Anger
"I breathed deeply and willed myself to stay calm. ""Yeah. It's just . . . it's been a while since I last went here.""",Anger
"""I could see that.""",Joy
It became hotter as we descended and it felt like my skin and bones would just melt.,Fear
I could also hear the screams and cries of the prisoners and it made my head throb in pain.,Sadness
Blood was splattered across his face and his blonde hair was dyed with scarlet hues.,Sadness
"""Ah. I just finished questioning this one,"" he said as he lifted the guy by grabbing his hair.",Anger
"""That's good,"" Aristus commented.",Joy
"""I need more information.""",Anger
"""I already know where that Custos is,"" Lionel said, smirking.",Joy
"""Ah. I wonder what kind of punishment I should give him.""",Anger
I shuddered upon hearing his words.,Fear
"Dale was an elusive target, even for us, yet he was already thinking of how he could make his life miserable.",Sadness
"""Really?"" I muttered as Farallon readied the boat",Anger
"""That's the rule, kid,"" he said.",Anger
"""You can't communicate with others within the island.""",Fear
"Farallon started pushing it toward the sea and before I knew it, Shima had already been shrouded in fog and mist",Sadness
I was left alone in the middle of the sea and I realized there was a brewing storm nearby.,Fear
"""Damn it,"" I muttered while getting the device the Commander gave me.",Anger
"""Naia,"" he greeted. ""Good to hear from you.",Joy
What happened?,Fear
"""The criminals have been transferred successfully, Commander,"" I reported.",Sadness
"""Also, one of the Executioners said he knows where Dale and Zeno are.",Fear
"""I'd like to know the details.""",Anger
"""Roger that, Commander.""",Joy
We walked back to the inland and Shira and Hyora greeted me,Joy
Farallon still couldn't believe that those beasts could still remember me and I was the only one that could cuddle them.,Anger
"""I heard you went to the blood chamber with Aristus,"" he said and my body almost trembled when I remembered what happened there.",Anger
"""Yeah. It was like coming back from hell.""",Anger
"He snickered. ""Right. Remember when you first went there?",Joy
I remembered sneaking out from the shack to follow Vince and Lionel who were escorting the new prisoners.,Sadness
"Besides, I admire both Vince and Lionel, even vowing to be their apprentice, but they both dismissed me.",Sadness
"I heard voices, several of them, crying and howling in agony and pain.",Sadness
It slowed me down but I thought I could control my mind.,Fear
One of the prisoners they were escorting hid a knife under his footwear and pretended to tumble.,Fear
"As a kid, I was beyond terrified.",Fear
The prisoner took me as a hostage.,Fear
I was terrified and I felt something was changing in my mind and body.,Fear
Colors flickered in my irises and I saw a lot of people getting slaughtered and skinned by the knife that was poking me.,Fear
"""Naia!""",Fear
Their eyes gleamed malevolently as they swung their scythes in the air.,Anger
"The next thing I knew, the head of the prisoner who was holding me rolled below my dangling body, the look of terror etched on his face.",Fear
"""Get her out of here,"" Lionel seethed as he looked at the rest of the prisoners who were as terrified as I was.",Anger
Vince immediately carried me and I remembered crying because he got angry at me.,Sadness
"I lost consciousness before we could leave the premise and the next thing I knew, I was already sleeping for two days and my eyes had changed permanently into red.",Sadness
"""Wow. I couldn't believe that was already a long time ago,""",Joy
"I said as I smiled, remembering Vince's life before he went away and died.",Sadness
"""Yeah. And now all we have is his skinny brat.""",Joy
"""Can this be used in, say, a fight against a Shinigami?"" he asked but before Aristus could reply, Farallon was already charging at their direction.",Fear
He tried fending off his attack but Farallon was physically stronger than him.,Anger
"""Yes it can, brat,"" he said. ""this blade has been bathed by Shinigamis' blood since it was made.""",Anger
"""He was trained by Ise along with Lionel and Vince. Physically, they are on par with them but he's lacking here,"" he added, pointing at his temple. ""In short, he's an idiot.""",Sadness
"""Huh?!""",Anger
"""Yes, that's his real attitude. He only acts quiet to look like Lionel but the truth is he's a lot more savage than Vince.""",Anger
"""Teach me,"" he suddenly said and that left Farallon dumbfounded.",Anger
"""Huh?""",Fear
"""Teach me how to wield it effectively,"" he repeated, the blade still digging onto his neck.",Anger
"""Naia,"" she called. ""Sorry if I wasn't able to talk to you.""",Sadness

"""It seems like we'll get a lot of prisoners in the coming days.""",Fear

I couldn't sleep.,Sadness
"After visiting the blood chamber, the voices I heard kept echoing inside my head.",Sadness
"In addition, I could still feel the adrenaline rushing through my veins.",Fear
I thought I could already control these ferocious tendencies when I lived outside this world but coming back here awakened them.,Sadness
I was itching to fight someone,Anger
"By nightfall, everything in the island was already engulfed in darkness.",Sadness
"""Curious, aren't you?""",Fear
"""What are you doing here?"" I asked as I pulled back my sword.",Fear
"""I figure you'd be restless by now,"" she replied.",Sadness

"""What do you mean?""",Anger
"""According to Aristus, Vince was still too young when his father died. Ise wanted to focus on training him so he wanted to have a capable man to lead the village temporarily",Sadness

"""Yup. He was found by Hideyoshi and became his right-hand man.""",Joy
"""I see. And after Vince died, Ise once again recommended Kyo as the chief.""",Joy

My breath caught in my throat as I stared at her,Fear

"With my remaining strength, I walked at their direction. Finally, we were together again.",Joy

"Zeno and Dale were bloodied, just like the rest of the Executives.",Sadness
Von had visible gunshots on his shoulders and leg but he didn't seem to mind them.,Sadness
Fenn had it worse. He had deep cuts on his hands and a long gash from his right to left cheek,Sadness

"""Tranquilizers don't work on them.""",Sadness
"""The gear slows down the brainwaves, much slower than the delta waves, so they appear to be in the state between sleep and death.""",Sadness

"""Commander,"" I greeted.",Fear
"""I assume you already know why you're here,"" he said",Anger
"With what had transpired before the capture of Dale and Zeno, I already had an idea about what he wanted me to do. My expression hardened",Sadness
