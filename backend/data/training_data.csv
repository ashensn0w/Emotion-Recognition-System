Okay lang ako! Ano ba kayo?,anger
Your tibialis anterior is damaged.,fear
"Ha? Saan ‘yun? Ay basta, ayos lang ako. Habulin na lang natin ‘yung kriminal at baka makatakas siya!",anger
"Sadly, he’s in the West.",sadness
"Tsk. Kailangan kong magtago. Alam na ng mga pulis na ako ang pumatay sa hayup na ‘yun,",fear
"After gamitin ng Mama ni Hiro ang cards  ay binigay niya ‘yun sa akin since Mama ko ang nagmamay-ari nun, ito na lang ang  remembrance ko sa kanya dahil...dahil...wala na rin si Demi na pusa niya.",sadness
‘Don’t think about it.’,sadness
"Kahit mag-iisang taon na simula nung nangyari ‘yung war, fresh pa rin sa isip ko lahat ng  nangyari. Lagi kong sinisisi ang sarili ko dahil sa pagkamatay ni Demi at dahil napakahina ko noon.",sadness
"Still thinking about it, nee-san?",sadness
Sa hill na naman? sabay ngiti sa akin ni Akane.,joy
"Huminga naman ako nang malalim para pigilan ‘yung luha ko. Nang matapos ang war, gabi-gabi kong napapanaginipan si Demi. Kahit naalam kong magkasama na sila ni Mama ngayon, nalulungkot pa rin ako.",sadness
"Hanggang ngayon, nagsisisi pa  rin ako sa nangyari.",sadness
"Nang matapos ang war, gabi-gabi kong napapanaginipan si Demi, kahit naalam kong magkasama na sila ni Mama ngayon, nalulungkot pa rin ako.",sadness
Ito na nga ba ang  tamang panahon para sa balak namin? Natatakot ako sa pwedeng mangyari pero ito ang dapat  naming gawin.,fear
Wala lang. Nag-iisip-isip. Ikaw?,sadness
Don’t worry. Kaya niya ang sarili niya. She’s one of the Great Seven.,joy
"Kahit sinabi ko ‘yun ay nag-aalala rin ako para kay Mama, at alam kong ganun din si Hiro.  ",fear
"Protective siya pagdating sa Mama niya, siguro dahil natatakot siyang mawala o malayo ulit sa  kanya",fear
Kahit na siya ang pinakamalakas sa amin ay natatakot pa  rin ako kapag umaalis siya.,fear
Natatakot ako na baka kung anong mangyari sa kanya.,fear
Sorry.,sadness
"Not really. Share sila ni Dad. Maybe she just want to brag,",joy
Yes. I remember what most people want to forget.,sadness
Bigla akong naawa sa kanya at kahit madilim ay kita ko ang lungkot sa mukha niya.,sadness
Just fill your mind with happy and positive thoughts.,joy
"Thanks, tapos kinuha niya ‘yung flower.",joy
"Kung hindi ‘to alam ni Sir Hideo, illegal ‘to. Tatakas tayo? Pero baka makita niya tayo.",fear
Wow ha. Naisip ni Darwin ‘yun?,joy
bakit kasi umaga ang PE class natin? Sino bang sira ang tuktok ang nagsuggest nito?,anger
"Utak talaga nun, may switch. Minsan on, madalas off.",anger
"Natawa naman ako sa sinabi niya hanggang sa umabot na ang pang-aasar niya kay Ken sa  pagkatao niya. Kapag nag-aaway sila, gumagaan lagi ang atmosphere. Kaya siguro super naging  close ako sa kanila nitong nagdaang taon dahil kapag kasama ko sila, nakakalimutan ko ‘yung  mga masasamang nangyari.",joy
"Anong ginagawa mo? Ang creepy, Akane. ",fear
"Hmm, 115 bpm. Definitely excited,",joy
Pfft. Nakakatawa ‘yung reaksyon mo kanina!,joy
Pano nakakatakot ‘yang itsura mo. Masyadong seryoso. ,fear
Hoy Ken! sabay batok niya kay Ken.,anger
Aray! Problema mo?! Sakit nun ha! Ginulo mo pa buhok ko!,anger
Magulo naman talaga buhok mo! Bakit ba kasi 6 AM ang nirequest mong class sa PE ha? May sira na ba ‘yang utak mo? ,anger
"It’s a good book, kumpleto rin ‘yung illustrations.",joy
Talaga? Thank you.,joy
Pinanood ko lang silang dalawa habang nag-uusap at napangiti ako.,joy
"Mmm. Nadiscover niya pa ngang nasa gitna ang Yllka Shrine ng major bases ng bawat tribes.  Though, mukhang ikaw ay alam mo na kaagad.",joy
Hindi niyo ako matatakasan.,anger
Nagsitayuan ang mga balahibo ko nung biglang may bumulong sa tenga ko.,fear
"Aatakihin ako sa puso ng wala sa oras dahil kay Ma’am Michiko eh. Pero ang  nakakainis, ako lang ang nagulat.",anger
Sorry. Mali ‘yung trajectory ng arrow ko.,sadness
It’s just a joke.,joy
Nagjojoke na si Hiro! Anong gagawin natin?!,joy
Nagtawanan lang kami doon at kahit papaano ay gumaan ulit ang atmosphere.,joy
"Nakatayo sa likuran ni Hiro sina Ma’am Reina, Sir Hayate at Sir Hiroshi. Hindi ko alam na  umuwi pala sila rito. Ngayon ko na lang ulit sila nakita!",joy
"Talaga po, Sir?",joy
At nung nagtakeoff kami ay pinangako ko sa sarili ko na hinding-hindi na ako sasakay dito.,fear
"Glad you're awake,",joy
After a few minutes ay nawala na 'yung bigat ng sikmura ko at medyo umayos ang pakiramdam  ko. Effective nga 'yung gamot. Sino kaya ang gumawa nun? Si Reiji? Si Riye? At paano kaya  nila nagawa 'yun?,joy
"""Teka, Sir. Hindi ba tayo mahuhuli nito dahil pumasok tayo sa Romania ng walang pasabi?"" tanong ni Akane habang nakasilip pa sa bintana at palakad-lakad.",fear
"lumabas sa aming tatlo. Sa wakas, nakaalis din! Huminga ako nang malalim at sobrang fresh ng  hangin dito pero sobrang lamig din.",joy
"Akemi, don't go that way,",fear
May naririnig akong wild animals. I think may wild bears at boars sa area na 'yun. ,fear
"S-siguro naman mechanism 'yan ng kweba no?"" tanong ko sa kanila.",fear
M-mukha nga. Hindi naman siguro tayo matatrap dito.,fear
Whoa...paanong...,joy
This place represents the different attributes of our tribe.,joy
Oh. Nice place. Hindi ko akalaing may nag-eexist na ganito.,joy
You're all here.,joy
"It's nice to see you again, Rainie.",joy
Kahit na civil kami sa isa't  isa ngayon ay may doubt pa rin kami sa kahihinatnan ng meeting na 'to.,fear
"Sure. It's better to be smart than only relying on brute strength."" Bigla namang tumingin si Nel  kay Krystal at alam kong anytime ay may mangyayari nang masama dahil bigla ulit tumaas ang  tension sa paligid.",fear
Are you implying something? ,anger
Uh oh. I smell trouble.,fear
"naririnig. Maging ang balat ko ay nararamdaman ang tension dahil tumaas ang mga balahibo ko  at nabalutan ng goose bumps. Pati sina Akane, Hiro at 'yung mga kasama nina Darwin, Krystal at  Nel ay naging alert din.",fear
"Well, I guess we still don't trust each other,",anger
I was slightly shaking because I instinctively aimed my arrowed-bullet gun to Darwin since I felt that pressure in his direction.,fear
Well said. You made your point very well.,joy
Did I sound rude?',fear
No. You sound like your dad—a leader.,joy
Napangiti naman ako at nabawasan ang burden sa loob ko dahil doon.,joy
Ayoko kasing lumabas na  rude at sabihing nagmamarunong ako dahil sa mga nasabi ko.,fear
She's having a  hard time these past few days. Sa inyo tuloy nabubuhos.,sadness
We should. Baka biglang magbago na naman ang mood ng iba.,fear
Nagamit ko na ang  Black Dimension ng ilang beses these past few months kahit hindi ko pa masyadong kontrolado  ang pagbukas at sara nun pero masasabi ko na sobrang mapanganib doon ngayon.,fear
"That place is  too quiet that I tend to hear a lot of buzzing and humming, plus the tension in the surrounding is  too high.",fear
Pakiramdam ko ay laging may nakatingin sa akin kapag nandoon ako kaya nga hangga't  maaari ay hindi muna ako nagtatravel doon kung hindi naman kailangan.,fear
Of course. Her team succesfully infiltrated the shinigami's base and retreived her comrades'eyes.,joy
"They're fine. Sa katunayan, mas maraming Shinigamis ang sumali sa amin nung nalaman nilang  buhay pa sila at sila ang naglelead. I guess my parents' reputation are good back then.",joy
That's great.,joy
Yes. Ayos na. I was devastated for the first few months after the war.Pero nakapagmove on na rin naman ako at marami na akong natutunan ngayon kaya ayos na ako.,joy
I see. I guess there's no need to worry about you.,joy
"Thanks for this, by the way. It warms me up since we're living on a cold place.",joy
"Sige, mauna na kami. It's nice seeing you again, Rainie.",joy
"Okay lang 'no. 'Di ba naging classmate mo siya dati bago kayo ma-involve sa mundo ng Erityians kaya alam naming nagcacatch-up kayo sa isa't isa. 'Di ba, Hiro?",joy
"Shit, hindi ko alam kung paano maglaland!",fear
"Uhm, I think pipindutin ang button na 'to while pulling down the lever.",fear
Yo-yo ka dyan! What the heck are you guys doing here?!,anger
"Nice. I didn't even notice it,",joy
Ang sakit nun ha!,anger
Bigla  akong kinabahan dahil baka nalaman ni Papa ang nangyaring secret meeting sa pagitan ng apat  na tribes kaya niya kami pinapatawag. Baka nagalit siya dahil hindi namin sinabi or hindi man  lang kami nag-consult sa kanya.,fear
"""They're here,"" sabi ni Papa at ngumiti naman ang kasama niya.",joy
Yes. You're going with me.,joy
That it's dangerous. She's worried about us.,fear
"Do you sense that presence, too?",fear
"After all, dahil sa mga  Shinigami kung bakit nawala ang apat sa Great Seven, kasama ang asawa niya pati na si Mama.  Alam kong masakit pa rin para sa kanya lahat ng nangyari kahit ilang taon na ang nakalipas,  ganun din para kay Papa at kay Ma'am Michiko.",sadness
Napangiti naman ako habang tinitignan ko siyang maglagay ng contacts.,joy
Napatingin din ako sa paligid at may naramdaman akong kakaiba. I scanned the people around  us and I saw several suspicious-looking persons observing us.,fear
"Mauna na kayo. I'll just clean this mess. You know where it is, right?",anger
Napatingin din ako sa kalapit na building kung nasaan ang isa pang nagmamanman sa amin at  nakita kong sinusundan niya pa rin kami ng tingin.,fear
Napasandal na lang ako at huminga nang malalim.,fear
"Do you sense that presence, too?",fear
"Oo. Pero hindi ko alam kung saan nanggagaling. I can't locate him or her,",fear
He built a miniature plane before and they named it Kaoru. Mukhang nagawa na niya talaga ang project na 'yun.,joy
"Don't let go,"" Hiro said. And the next thing I knew, the Black Dimension was already closing  and I saw the pain in his expression.",fear
"Naramdaman ko rin ang lalong paghigpit ng braso ng Shinigami sa  leeg ko, to the point na hindi na ako makahinga.",fear
"H-Hiro... I tapped his face but he's not responding. ""Don't you dare die on me. Hiro...please, gumising ka.""",fear
Please...,fear
I'm sorry.,sadness
Sobrang natakot ako sa nangyari sa kanya. Nung nakita ko siyang unti-unting nawawalan ng malay kanina ay parang bagyong pumasok ulit sa isip ko lahat ng nangyari noong war. The deaths of the people I knew flashed on my mind…  ...especially Demi's.,sadness
"Natakot akong may mawawala na namang importante sa akin. I've already lost my mother, my  friend, comrades and teachers. I don't want to lose someone anymore.",sadness
"You did protect me,",joy
You almost died.,fear
"""But I'm still alive."" Bumitiw siya at hinarap niya ako sa kanya, ""And it's because of you. So don't say you're weak because you're not.""",joy
I think we ended up at the place we're looking for,fear
Anong gagawin natin?,fear
"""Let's keep an eye on the surroundings from here first. We need to wait for them before doing something. They're coming, right?"" Tumango naman ako as a confirmation.",fear
 Bigla naman akong may naramdamang presence na papalapit sa amin kaya naging alert ang isip  at katawan ko.,fear
What did you do? Two of your fatal points are in dire state.,fear
No. Those are called fatal points for a reason. Pwede kang mamatay kapag lumala pa ang injury mo.,fear
"""Dahil nalaman nilang nandito sa Japan si Naomi at Rainie. Of course, as one of the Great Seven,  they want to take her down,"" sagot ni Darwin.",fear
"""Wait, bakit pati ako?"" Naintindihan ko 'yung part about Hiro's mom pero bakit na naman nila  ako kailangan? Dahil pa rin ba sa kadahilanang ako ang anak ni Rielle/Akemi?",fear
N-no way. My eyes are not that...,fear
"""He's right,"" dagdag naman ni Hiro. ""Plus your eyes have different shades of green. It's peculiar.""",fear
Gusto kong sumunod sa kanila pero baka maging  pabigat lang ako sa kanila dahil sa injury ko.,sadness
They are in trouble.,fear
"Ako ang kailangan ninyo, hindi ba?!",anger
Napangiti ako dahil sinunod nila ako at mas minabuti nilang ituloy ang plano.,joy
Napatingin naman ako sa lalaking inatake ko. He's not moving anymore.,joy
"""Take me, if you can,"" malakas kong sabi at kinilabutan ako nung naramdaman ko ang sabay sabay na pagbukas ng ilang parts ng Black Dimension.",fear
I smiled triumphantly.  I fulfilled my role.,joy
 But I don't think I can last any longer because all of them lunged at me.,sadness
These Shinigamis are going to kill me.,fear
"Hindi ba, Mama?",joy
"Ako na muna ang bahala sa kanila,",anger
"""This'll temporarily numb the pain but you should not do anything reckless anymore. Got that?""  then after that, may cold sensation akong naramdaman na pumasok sa balat ko. It stung at first  but after some time, the searing and throbbing pain subsided.",joy
 Para akong nabunutan ng tinik nung hindi ko na masyadong maramdaman ang sakit ng balikat at  braso ko.,joy
"Naramdaman ko naman bigla ang tuluy-tuloy na pagbukas at pagsara ng Black Dimension sa  paligid namin at isa lang ang ibig sabihin nun--they are sending reinforcements and they really  know we're here. They must have known our plans, too.",fear
" ""Man, our plan is now messed up!"" sabay upo ni Nel sa kaliwa ko at sumunod naman si Krystal sa kanya.",fear
 Oh. A cute eyeglasses-wearing guy helped us,joy
"Napatigil naman ako sa pag-iisip nung naramdaman ko na naman ang pagbukas ng Black  Dimension, and this time, kinilabutan ako dahil sobrang laking parte ang unti-unting bumubukas.",fear
What the hell is this creepy feeling?,fear
"So you are really here, kid. Rielle's daughter.",joy
One more word and I'll behead you.,anger
"If you could, old hag.",anger
" You're going with us, whether you like it or not.",anger
Hindi ako sasama sa inyo kahit ano pang gawin n'yo. I'd rather die than being in your hands.,anger
"Then die,",anger
"""You really look like her,"" sabi naman nung lalaking katabi niya and for a second ay akala ko si  Darwin ang nakatingin sa akin. He must be his father.",joy
"It's been a long time, Izumi, Kurai.",joy
I have a bad feeling about this.,fear
"""I should have done this years ago,"" sabi naman ni Papa at kahit hindi ko nakikita ang expression niya ay naramdaman ko ang sakit sa bawat salitang binitiwan niya.",sadness
Go all out. Erase this place where she suffered a lot.,anger
"That's my plan from the very start,",anger
Hey! Where are you going?!,fear
Chase him!,anger
Heh. So ikaw ang anak ng traydor na 'yun?,anger
Ako nga. I am the daughter of Rielle. Do you have any problems with that?,anger
"I really find it frustrating when they label her as a traitor. Hindi siya tanggap ng Senshins at hindi  rin siya kinikilala ng Shinigamis. Kung ako nga ay nasasaktan para sa kanya ngayon, gaano pa  kaya kasakit ang naramdaman niya noon?",sadness
Gusto kong masaktan at umiyak para sa kanya pero alam kong ayaw niya 'yung mangyari. It's  exasperating but I know her hardships were for me.,sadness
"I won't let you touch him,",anger
"That's my girl. Kidding,",joy
"""Are you okay?"" tanong ni Darwin nung makalapit na siya sa akin.",fear
"Y-Yeah. By the way, nasaan si Hiro?",fear
"This system is complicated. Kapag nagkamali tayo ng password, mala-lock lahat ng files dito at hindi na natin mabubuksan kahit anong mangyari.",fear
So that means we only have one chance.,fear
"""Eyes can be me or shishen but—"" Pagkasabi ko nun ay nagkatinginan kami bigla at alam kong  halos pareho kami ng naisip. This 8-letter word password might be a wordplay. If that's the case, then…",joy
"Kailangan na nating umalis dito,",fear
The Shinigamis surrounding us were wiped out instantly.,joy
"As I was looking at my father taking down the building, I felt a sense of relief and sadness.  Seeing his actions, I know that he wanted to do this after all this time. He wanted to erase this  place where my mother suffered.",sadness
Nakatingin lang ako sa chip. Natatakot ako sa maaari kong malaman base sa data na nakalap  namin ni Darwin pero gusto kong makilala si Mama.,fear
Yeah. I'm scared to know the truth.,fear
"""Y-your arm!"" sigaw ko at halos isigaw ko ang pangalan ni Riye pero narealize kong kaming dalawa lang ang nandito ngayon.",fear
"Sorry, Rainie. Sorry if I can't say anything about your mother.",sadness
"To our ancestor, Ryou!"" sigaw nila habang nakataas ang mga sandata. ""Let this victory mark the  start of another era! Shinigamis!",joy
Bigla tuloy akong naguilty dahil hindi ko man lang ulit sila nakita para makapagpasalamat. They  are the reason why I survived the fight. If it weren't for them…,sadness
Tinanggal ko ang kamay ko sa mga mata niya at napangiti ako nung nakita kong   natutulog na siya.,joy
Inuna kong tignan ang pictures na nakalagay doon at halos  sumikip ang dibdib ko habang ginagawa ko 'yun.,sadness
Nararamdaman ko ang hirap  at sakit na dinanas niya. Alam kong sobrang hirap ng pinagdaanan niya base sa mga kwentong  naririnig ko pero ngayong nakikita ko ang nangyari ay mas malala pa pala 'to kaysa sa iniisip ko.,
"Please, let me hold her for the first and last time,",sadness
"""Is that your last wish?"" Tumango si Mama. ""I'll give you fifteen seconds. Cherish it.""",sadness
Parang lumubog ang puso ko nung narinig ko 'yun.,sadness
Nakatingin lang ako sa paanan ko dahil feeling ko ay maiiyak lang ulit ako kapag hinarap ko siya,sadness
Hindi ko pa kayang basahin ang iba pang files na nakalagay doon dahil sobrang bigat na kaagad ng pakiramdam ko.,sadness
"""Nakakamiss,"" bulong ko at tumango naman si Darwin.",sadness
"It's nice to see the both of you again,",joy
"""Sobrang isolated pala talaga natin dati,"" sabi ko sa kanya.",joy
"""Thanks for keeping me company,"" sabi niya at saka siya ngumiti.",joy
"Nag-enjoy din naman ako so no worries.""",joy
"You did the same, too. Kaya salamat din at ganun ang tingin mo sa akin.",joy
Dungeon. Sobrang sakit makita lahat ng 'yun. Sobrang sakit malaman lahat ng pinagdaanan niya para sa akin.,sadness
Nandito ako ngayon sa harap ng puntod niya. Kanina pa ako nakaupo rito dahil gusto ko lang  siyang makasama ngayong araw. Gusto kong nasa tabi niya ako ngayon dahil alam kong ilang  buwan siyang naging mag-isa nung nasa tiyan niya pa lang ako. I want to return her love for me.,sadness
Bigla namang tumulo ang luha ko habang inaalala ang lahat ng 'yun.,sadness
"I really admire you, Mama. You're so strong. And even if nobody's talking about you here  because they said you were a curse, you will always be my hero. It's just sad that you're not here anymore.",sadness
Pinunasan ko ang luha ko pero tuluy-tuloy pa rin silang tumutulo.,sadness
Ang daming what-ifs ngayon sa isip ko. Ang dami kong gustong gawin kasama sina Mama at  Papa pero alam kong hinding-hindi na 'yun mangyayari kahit ano pang gawin ko.,sadness
Hindi ko na napigilan ang sarili ko at napahagulgol na ako. ,sadness
"Sobrang sakit para sa akin na hindi  man lang kami naging buo, ni hindi man lang niya nakasama ang pamilya niya nang matagal.",sadness
"Kung ganito na kasakit para sa akin, hindi ko maimagine kung gaano kasakit ang naramdaman during those times.",sadness
She died in his arms.,sadness
"I don't know, he said and I saw the sadness in his eyes. ""These past few months, I've been recollecting some unfamiliar memories.""",sadness
There are memories inside my head that keeps on appearing even though I'm not that familiar  with them. It seems like I subconsciously pushed them away to the farthest place on my mind but  they're slowly coming back.,sadness
Memories when I was still a kid.,sadness
But remembering is just as worse as forgetting.,sadness
I was carried by someone. His whole body was bleeding and I can hear myself crying. I saw the President's face. The man holding me was saying something to him...,sadness
He said I should always protect Mom. For him.,sadness
"""Then I saw a dying woman."" I froze when I heard that.",sadness
" Halos lumubog ang puso ko dahil alam  ko kung sino ang tinutukoy niya. ""I can't remember all the things she said but she died smiling. I  remember being soaked in the rain in the arms of your father. His cries filled the place. After  that, my memories become hazy and I can't remember anything anymore.""",sadness
"Napatingin ulit ako sa puntod ni Mama at hindi ko akalaing namatay siya nang nakangiti. Really,  how strong are you, Mama? I can't believe she managed to put a smile on her face after all the  sufferings she experienced. Then I realized, it must be because of my father. After all, they were  together until the end.",sadness
Looking into your eyes made me feel better.,sadness
"Our truce might be turning into an alliance, finally.",joy
"""Hindi po ako makatulog."" Automatic na tumulo ang luha ko pagkasabi ko nun at agad kong  tinago ang mukha ko sa hood ng cloak na suot ko pero naramdaman ko ang kamay niya sa ulo ko.",sadness
You don't need to hide your tears.,sadness
Napatingin ako sa kanya at nakita kong tahimik lang siyang lumuluha habang nakatingin sa puntod ni Mama.,sadness
"Your mother did this to me, too. You really have the same actions.",sadness
"Wow. So binabantayan mo pala ang mga kilos niya, Papa.",joy
Pwede bang hayaan mo akong gawin 'to? I didn't have the chance to put you to sleep when you were still a child.,joy
You and your freaking sixth sense. Ubos na nga!,anger
"""Hello again,"" masayang bati ni Gemma sa amin.",joy
"""Whoa. Too many new faces!"" sigaw ni Nel nung nakalapit na siya sa amin.",joy
Still unstable but we're recovering. Thanks to all of you.,joy
"I just want to celebrate our victory, and of course, the end of our truce.",joy
Wow. That was a good point but you sounded like a humdrum politician.,joy
"Wow. Thank you, Darwin. I'm going to use this.",joy
"The next time we see each other, we should be the leaders.",joy
"Thank you,' rinig ko sa isip ko. 'Rainie.'",joy
" I, Rainie Lopez, bestowed with the name Akemi, will now lead and protect the Senshin tribe with  the best of my ability.",joy
I'm really excited for the future.,joy
Where is he?,sadness
"Do you want to see him?"" I nodded. ""Follow me.",sadness
"I'm back, Vince,",sadness
So you're also here.,sadness
I can't believe we're having our reunion right here.,sadness
"""Even though a lot of things happened, I'm glad that I still have the both of you,"" I said while keeping my tears from falling. ""So please...don't you ever dare to die on me, too.""",sadness
"""Stay still,"" I ordered. ""This will somehow soothe your mind.""",sadness
I should be the one saying sorry.,sadness
Sorry...Nathan...Nathalie…,sadness
"""It's not your fault, Nathan,"" bulong ko sa kanya. ""You're just a child that time.""",sadness
But because of me...,sadness
"He chose to protect you. He did everything to save our future so instead of being sorry, be thankful to your father. Will you do that for me, Nathan?",sadness
"At least, meron. This is the first time na may madadagdag sa batch natin.",joy
Sungit.,anger
Hi Mitsuo! Welcome to Atama family!,joy
Tss.,anger
What a rude guy.,anger
But what he did isn't nice.,anger
"The other member. 'Yung babae,",joy
Success! Nagulat ko siya!,joy
"At muntik ka na ring mapuruhan,",fear
"""Pfft. Hahaha! Labanan ba 'to ng facial expression? Ikaw, expressionless,"" sabay turo ni Michiko kay Hideo. ""Ito namang si Mitsuo parang laging galit!""",joy
"Sorry. Sinasabi niya talaga lahat ng gusto niyang sabihin,",anger
Tss. I want to get out of this place immediately. Why do I have to be with these people? I'm going to kick that old fart's ass when I get back.',anger
"Gising na si Hiroshi,",joy
I'll be back.,joy
"""We're really famous,"" sabay tawa ni Michiko dahil nga maraming nakatingin sa amin. ""Right, Hiroshi?""",joy
Tinatawag ka ng bata.,anger
Tsk!,anger
Are you afraid of kids? Or you just can't handle them?,fear
Take care of this snot. I need to do my job.,anger
"What?! Then I'll do that instead—!""",anger
Umaangal ka na ba ngayon?,anger
"Good boy, Vince,",joy
"Damn you, old fart, are you playing with me?!",fear
Mitsuo?,joy
Pffft! Para siyang mamamatay na!,joy
Damn! May mas malala pa pala kay Hideo sa paghahandle ng bata! Hahaha!,joy
Looks like you're interested with him.' ,joy
Aren't we the same?,joy
Yeah. I think so.,joy
"Well, being curious isn't bad.",joy
"""Wait,"" sabay hawak ko sa balikat niya. ""Don't touch her.""",anger
"""O ito, gamitin mo,"" sabi ni Michiko habang inaabot sa kanya ang gloves. ""Wag na 'wag kang hahawak ng bangkay with bare hands. Baka makuha nila ang fingerprints natin. You know, kakaiba ang katawan natin kaya siguradong magsususpect ang humdrum community."" ",anger
"Huh? Baliw ka ba? Kailangan mong baligtarin 'tong katawan para makita mo 'yun! Makikita tayo ng mga humdrum police! Baka bigla na lang tayong paalisin dito dahil ginalaw natin 'to,",fear
Ugh! Ang kulit!,anger
You only have three seconds. Kaya gawin niyo na lahat within three seconds,fear
Whoa! Akala ko 'di tayo aabot!,fear
Muntik na akong mamatay sa sobrang kaba!,fear
I'm...I'm falling…,fear
"Hideo, help me…",fear
Careful,fear
Bakit hindi mo binabasa?,anger
"I'm sorry, Naomi.",sadness
Saan si Mama? Saan si Papa?,fear
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.,sadness
What are you doing here?,anger
I should be the one asking that. What are you doing—!,sadness
"""Someone's coming,"" he whispered. ""Two of them, actually.""",fear
"""Relax,"" bulong niya. ""They won't see us.""",fear
How can you be so sure? They are—,fear
"Calm down. To conceal one's presence, you should always be coolheaded and unflustered.",fear
Hey.,joy
Yeah right. Nakita ko na so no need to hide it.,joy
"Damn it,",joy
"""Gusto ko silang mabasa,"" sabi niya habang nakatingin sa libro. Actually, me too.",joy
Well . . . siguro naman hindi ganun kahirap i-decode 'to.,joy
"Kahit naman hampasin ko siya ng tubo, wala pa ring expression 'yung mukha niya,",joy
Oo meron pero na kay Naomi na. Hiramin mo sa kanya kung gusto mo. Bye.,joy
What happened?,anger
Isn't that Miss Naomi of Atama family?,joy
"Oo nga! Wow, minsan ko lang makita ang members nila.",joy
"Sabi nila, she's one of the smartest woman inside this campus.",joy
"You look so confident and calculating outside but deep inside, you're anxious and insecure of yourself.",sadness
Sir Eiichi!,fear
"No need to panic, Naomi.",joy
"What do you mean by that, Sir?",fear
Mitsuo?,fear
"Damn it, where did he go—!",anger
What are you going to do now?,fear
That's what you get for following me.,anger
"Hey, stop it!",fear
W-what—,fear
"Shit, I said stop it!",anger
"These creatures can smell fear and they are attracted to it. If you don't want to attract more of them, calm yourself!",fear
"C'mon Naomi, calm down!",anger
"""Let me hold this for a while,"" I breathed. ""Please."" ",anger
Don't let go until you're really calm.,anger

Yeah. Him. He and Akemi are acting suspiciously. Don't you think?,fear
"""They are hiding their background,"" dagdag ko. ""And they must have a reason for doing that. I want to know those reasons.""",fear

"Nathalie, listen. You should never allow anyone to invade your mind.",fear
"""Why, Mom?"" I asked and she smiled at me.",joy
"Because they might search for your secrets and weaknesses. The power of our family is a gift, and a curse at the same time.",fear
A curse?,fear
"Yes, child. Our minds are closed in default, hence, they will not be able to read them easily.",fear
"Yes, Mom.",fear
"A detective should always know how and who to follow, though.",fear
But I am not someone you can follow carelessly.,anger
"""Don't intimidate me,"" sabi ko at bigla kong naalala ang nangyari sa gubat noon. ""I won't allow you to intimidate me again.""",fear

Stop reading my mind.,anger

What?!,anger
W-where are you going?,anger
Bakit? Susundan mo na naman ako?,anger
Yes. Because you're too suspicious!,anger
Who boldly tells someone they follow that they are suspicious? I don't know if you're brave or just plain stupid.,anger

And you're insane.,anger
You could say that.,anger
Really insane.,anger
This girl's punches and hits are really strong and hard. What the hell is she?,anger
I heard that.,anger
Shit.,anger
"I heard that, too.",anger
 You monsters. Are you serious?,anger
"""Matutulog ka na?"" tanong ni Akira no'ng papunta na ako sa kama. ""Wait! Samahan mo muna akong kumain sa plaza!""",joy

"Sorry, Reina. Okay ka lang ba?",fear
Gusto mo ba ng ice cream?,fear
Yes! Yes! Yes!,joy
Ah! Kuya Misho!,joy
Kanina ka pa niya tinatawag.,anger
"Sama ka, Kuya Misho!",joy
Hanap ko si Hayate . . .,sadness
What?,anger
Why did you drag me into this?' ,anger
"I'm not the one who dragged you, though. It's her.'",anger
You know I don't like kids,anger
Then maybe it's time for you to change that.',anger
Tss. Stupid.',anger
Kuya Misho?,joy
"Tumama lang ang paa niya sa lamesa, Reina,",joy
What the hell are you doing?!,anger
Ohh. 'Di ba si Naomi 'yon ng Atama family?,joy
"Si Mitsuo rin! He's the newest guy in the Atama family, right?",joy
Whoa. He looks so cool.,joy
He looks angry.,fear
I told you not to call me stupid. Cool your head off and stay with her.,anger
"Umalis na. He's on a mission right now. Anyway,"" sabay adjust niya sa position niya para nakaharap siya sa akin. ""What's the deal between you and Mitsuo? Mukhang nagiging malapit na kayo ah?",joy
He's annoying. Calling me stupid and funny. Who is he anyway? Damn him.,anger
"""Pfft."" Bigla namang tumawa si Akira kaya tinignan ko rin siya nang masama. ""Bukod sa pagsosolve ng crimes, ngayon lang ulit kita nakitang ganito kafrustrated.""",joy

Oh! Sila Hideo!,joy
What happened to Rei-,fear
"Please stop hitting me,",fear
"Kanina, nakasalubong namin sina Hideo at Mitsuo. Tapos 'di ba parang laging aloof siya kay Naomi pero nagulat kami nung lumapit siya sa kanya. Tapos—",joy
"Stop it, Akira!'",anger
"Tapos—hahahaha! Sabi sa kanya ni Mitsuo, ""please stop hitting me"" tapos natulala lang si Naomi kanina at napasagot siya ng ""okay"" My gosh kung nakita mo lang 'yung itsura nila kanina! Nakakatawa talaga!",joy
"Nakakatawa talaga! As in seryosong-seryoso 'yung expression ni Mitsuo eh. Ganito, oh. Please stop hitting me.",joy
Was that the real him? Was that the real him? The dark past he's trying to hide?,fear
An Emotion Called Love?,fear
Complex? Do you think love is a complex idea?,anger
"""Especially with your family,"" sabay ngiti niya. ""Family is just a responsibility. A duty that you will never escape. So don't mistake it with love.""",joy
"Seventh sense, huh?",joy
What's wrong?,anger
"She killed herself . . . maybe because she can't take the pain anymore,",sadness
"She wants to frame you,",sadness
siguro dahil kay Francis. Mas una silang nagkakilala pero ikaw ang minahal niya. Alam mong mahal siya ng kapatid mo dati pa pero kayo pa rin ang nagkatuluyan.,sadness
"Love is dangerous, and is just next door to death.",sadness
"Be careful. Shinigamis are not easy to deal with,",fear
I know. I've met some before. But you know what? Sinful Senshins are harder to handle than them.,fear
What do you mean—!,anger
You said you will stop hitting me. You broke a promise.,joy
I didn't promise anything. I just said okay.,anger
I know.,fear
"It's been a long time since I fought seriously,",joy
Time to devour the enemies.,anger
"You must be Naomi,",anger
Who are you?,fear
Let's just say I have a personal grudge against you.,anger
"Typical for a Shinigami to have a grudge over something that doesn't actually matter,",fear
It does matter since you have something you stole away from me.,anger
I never stole anything from anyone.,fear
You did.,anger
"Haruka, don't be too involved.",fear
"But it's true. I just want to tell her that, Daiki.",fear

Akemi!,fear
"Are you okay? Saan ka galing?""",fear
Rooftop. Nakita ko 'yung Custos doon kanina pero hindi ko siya napigilan.,fear
"Shit. Hindi ko kayo kayang buhating dalawa,",anger
Nagpanic naman ako sa sinabi ni Akemi.,fear
Careful.,fear
Ikaw na ba ang bahala sa kanya?,sadness
Yeah.,sadness
Wow. Ngayon na lang ulit nadagdagan ang Atama. So you mean the girl in the other room is new too?,joy
Is she okay now?,sadness
Yes but she needs to rest.,sadness
Looks like your foot is okay.,joy
Why did you stay here?,sadness
I felt responsible for what had happened.,sadness
Pero ako ang may kasalanan.,sadness
"Pero kung naging mas mabilis ako sa kilos ko, sana hindi kayo nandito. I was there but I can't even protect both of you. I'm a man but I let two girls to get hurt in front of me.",anger
I didn't expect him to be a gentleman. Ang tumatak na impression ko sa kanya ay short-tempered and cold pero ngayon ay nasaksihan ko ang pagiging caring niya. Wow.',joy
"We're the same, huh? Born and raised to be killers.",joy
"""Are you really . . ."" I opened my eyes and he stopped walking. ""Are you really an . . . an executioner?""",fear
"So you heard it, huh?",joy
That's why I'm regretting that decision.,sadness
"""Why?"" tanong ko. ""Is it because you can't kill people anymore?""",fear
"Then kill me,",anger
"I'll believe your words if you kill me. Pull it,",anger
So you can't. Fuck it!,anger
"Stay away from me,""",anger
"Don't want to,",anger
"You'll regret this,",anger
May gusto ka ba sa kanya? ,joy
"I really found it weird, I mean those Shinigamis. It was like they knew us and the Custos agent was too strong but they still divided their forces and chose to fight us. Why? Do they have a hidden motive? What is it?",fear
Anong ginagawa—,joy
Let's go.,joy
"Si Miss Naomi ng Atama family 'yon, 'di ba?",joy
Oo nga. I heard she's injured. Why is she here?,sadness
Wow. I can't believe I'm looking at her right now.,joy

Mitsuo?,joy
Anong ginagawa mo dyan?,joy
"Wala lang,",joy
"Para kang stalker,",joy
Really?,fear
Yes and it's creepy.,joy
That's it!,joy
What's it?,joy
It's like what you said. Something's missing with this book. Si Demi ang kumuha ng librong 'to sa restricted section. I bet there's a second book or a twin book na kailangang gamitin para maintindihan ang content nito.,joy
You're right. Parang pinutol talaga ang paragraphs pero kahit na na-cut ay comprehensible pa rin naman kaso walang depth.,joy
That means nasa restricted section ang other half ng librong 'to. But I don't think I can steal again from that room.,sadness
I think I can get that book.,joy
Really? Are you sure?,joy
"You should learn from the expert,",joy
"You're a bad girl, aren't you?",fear
"Not as bad as you,",anger
Of course. I'm the worst.,anger
"So this is the book, huh?",joy
"Identity, huh? Sino ka ba talaga, Mitsuo?",fear
"So our theory is really true,",joy
Nagseselos ka ba?,joy
Curious my ass.,joy
Akemi.,fear
Hideo.,fear
"I won't ask anything but seriously, you guys should control your presence,",fear
That place. Later.,fear
God. I can't concentrate.,fear
"Oohh. It has been a long time since you've been this distracted,",joy
What? I'm not.,fear
"The head never lies. Your inner voice is reverberating through the room. Right, Akemi?",joy
Hay. Bakit ba ganito ang roommates ko?,sadness
"Hey,",joy
W-well . . . uhm . . . I think I need some advice.,fear
"""Mitsuo."" After saying his name, Mayu smiled at me. ""He's been invading my mind lately and it feels strange.""",joy
I thought you like him?,joy
"Yes, that's because I have the same symptoms written on the book.",joy
But why do I like him?,joy
"And it's something you can't easily explain,",joy
"You came, huh?",joy
"So, what do you want to say?",fear
Are you leaving?,fear
"""I do not belong here. I told you, didn't I? You shouldn't get close to me but you're too persistent."" ""And I ended up caring for you. Hah. I'm doomed."" When I heard his thoughts, my breathing became erratic.",anger
W-why?,fear
I must return to my rightful place.,anger
And where is that place? A-are you perhaps an enemy.,fear
"It's better if you do not know,",anger
Why? Is it because you're a Shinigami?,fear
"You're really funny,",anger
"I'm not,",anger
"Then, who are you?",anger
"""A memory,"" he answered. ""Someone you should treat as one.""",anger
"I'll leave during the break and tell them that I won't return anymore,",anger
Why me?,anger
Why? Are you afraid to face them?,anger
"Then, I don't want to,",anger
"Forget about me,",sadness
"But . . . I like you, ",fear
Please don't.,sadness
Days passed and we didn't talk to each other. What happened that night made us tense and uncomfortable toward each other though I didn't know why.,sadness
Let's stop this.,sadness
"Naaalala ko na naman. Ni hindi ko nga alam kung ano ang kailangang itigil. I was pretty sure it  was a one-sided affection but that statement confused me more, and confusion was one of the  things I hate the most.",sadness
"""Alam kong napapansin mo rin . . ."" Her voice trailed off but I already knew what she wanted to  say through her inner voice. ""Something is really strange about Akemi though I don't know what.""",fear
"""I know,"" sagot ko naman. ""She gives off a dangerous vibe and her sudden disappearances make  me more doubtful.""",fear
"""You mean, the both of you are complex,"" she retorted. ""It's too obvious that you guys are  attracted to each other.""",joy
"""Hindi na namin tatanungin kung saan ka galing pero aalis na kami,"" Akira said with her teasing smile",joy
"""Don't worry. Your secret moments are safe with me,"" she said.",joy
"I like him, I had admitted that, but I don't think it was right. Yes, he's a great and gentle person  despite of his appearance and action but his memories . . . those thoughts that I have seen showed  otherwise. His glaring eyes, cunning smile, his clothes soaked in people's blood and the sword he  was holding . . . his memories made me shudder in fear.",fear
"""Miss!"" sabay hawi sa akin ng isang babae. ""Tumakbo ka na! May mamamatay-tao d'yan! Dali!""",fear
"The murderer  turned around and locked eyes with me. When I saw his scarred face, I almost stopped breathing.",fear
"""You . . ."" he growled while pointing his finger at me. ""You . . .""",anger
"I was paralyzed with fear and confusion but his raging, intense, green eyes showed no sympathy.",fear
"""Run away! Now! He's going to kill everyone!"" With much fear in my voice, and I wasn't faking  it, my warning was effective.",fear
Stop! I said stop!,anger
"You're the same as them!"" he roared and held the knife with both of his hands, aiming at my  chest. ""You want to kill me! Die! Die!",anger
I finally found you.,joy
"""I'm sorry,"" he whispered.",sadness
I didn't know why but tears started falling from my eyes. ,sadness
"""And this is why I don't want you to get close to me,"" he breathed and I felt the thumping of his  heart against his chest. ""But I'm glad you're safe. I'm really glad and thankful.""",joy
"""Liar,"" I said between my sobs.",anger
"""I know,"" he mumbled and we stayed like that for another minute.",joy
"""Something good is happening,"" sabay lingon niya sa akin habang nakangiti.",joy
I can't. I saw it with my own eyes. That guy . . . he's a Senshin and I don't understand why he did that.,sadness
"""He was what?"" tanong ko naman matapos ang nangyari kay Akemi.",fear
"""Why?"" mahina kong tanong. ""Is it some kind of classified mission?""",fear
"""Maybe,"" I replied and I heard him chuckle. ""What's funny?""",anger
Your stubbornness.,joy
"You should not worry about it anymore,",joy
Curiosity is a good thing.,joy
"""Curiosity killed the cat,"" he countered. Playing proverbs with me now, huh?",fear
Tinignan naman niya  ako na para bang may mali sa sinabi ko.,fear
"Thank you for everything,",joy
"You're cool, clever and dependable,",joy
"""I'm sorry,"" he whispered and when I noticed something was wrong with his tone, it was all too  late. I felt a sharp sensation on my neck and the next thing I knew, my senses were already fading.",sadness
"Thank you, but I shouldn't be loved. I might hurt and break you so give your heart to someone who could really protect you. But your feelings toward me, I'll treasure it.",joy
"""Nathalie?"" I opened my eyes and Akira's face was the first thing I saw. ""You're finally awake!""",joy
"""What happened?"" I asked but none of them responded.",fear
"""Where is he?"" tanong ko kaagad. ""And Akemi?""",fear
"""They're gone,"" he said in a soft voice but his words resonated across the room. ""And they're not  coming back anymore.""",sadness
"Thank you, but I shouldn't be loved. I might hurt and break you so give your heart to someone  who could really protect you. But your feelings toward me, I'll treasure it.",sadness
"It's okay if he doesn't reciprocate  my feelings, as long as he's with us but that won't happen anymore.",sadness
"""Noong una pa lang, alam kong may kakaiba na sa kanya,"" dagdag naman ni Mayu. ""She's not  the same as us, as well as Mitsuo.""",fear
"Silence followed and the tension went up. I know that we all have the same thoughts but we're  afraid to say it . . . to know the truth. After all, we considered them as a member of the family.",fear
"""W-wait, what do you mean by that?"" tanong ni Michiko.",fear
"""Wait . . . Mitsuo brought his gun. Can you detect him?"" tanong ko naman at ang bilis ng tibok  ng puso ko dahil sa kaba.",fear
"Executioners? Wait, I think I've read something about them before.",fear
"""Well, they are wielders . . . and killers."" After saying that, it felt like the temperature in the room dropped.",fear
You'll learn everything along the way but let me tell you that this mission is dangerous and you  should always be alert. Do you understand?,fear
"""Who are you?"" I whispered but nobody answered.",fear
"Suddenly, the hair on my nape tingled and someone spoke near my ear.",fear
"""I'm here,"" the voice whispered and before I could even react, he pulled me into a dark space  cutting through the air—the Black Dimension.",fear
"""You're going to die here, Senshin,"" he said with a frightening smile.",anger
I groaned as the heat intensified and I felt like my organs were already melting. I can't feel  anything anymore.,fear
"""Die, Senshin. Die. Die,"" he continuously chanted.",anger
Don't touch her.,anger
"We're dangerous, that's why we shouldn't leave this place carelessly,",fear
"""You're too young to understand everything, little runt,"" the guy said. ""But who knows? You  might find someone who can understand us. Now let's go. Time to work.""",sadness
"Don't move. You'll just hurt yourself,",fear
"""You look fine,"" I asked using my inner voice since I can't talk.",joy
"It was already dark and it looked like we're inside a forest, but I'm sure this isn't the one I'm  familiar with. The trees looked eerie and the wind sounded like whispers.",fear
In the lair of my next target.,anger
"""Dead,"" he said in a cold voice and that made me shiver.",sadness
D-dead? How?,sadness
Did you kill him?,sadness
"Rather than the Mitsuo from Atama family, his presence right  now  appeared to be that of an Executioner . . . a killer.",fear
"""Are you surprised?"" tanong niya at ako naman ang hindi nakasagot. ""I told you several times  that you shouldn't get close to me and this is the reason why.""",sadness
Our own tribe looks at us differently because of our  nature and our reason for living.,sadness
"""An Executioner . . ."" I whispered and his eyes glinted with cruelty.",fear
"""So you knew,"" sabi niya. Nakaramdam naman ako ng takot at gusto kong lumayo sa kanya  pansamantala. ""And you're afraid.""",fear
"Yes, and this one is dangerous and unpredictable,",fear
"""Got you,"" he said with a sinister smile",joy
"""Damn you, Jikko guy!"" sigaw ng Huntres.",anger
I shall kill you first.,anger
"""Don't move,"" Mitsuo said inside my mind. His words seemed like an order . . . and a threat.",fear
We were surrounded by an uncomfortable silence and that made it harder to breathe.,fear
"""Why did you kill him?"" I asked, breaking the silence.",sadness
"""To protect you,"" he said and that made me look at him.",sadness
Do you really need to kill him?' ,sadness
"""I was born to kill,"" he said. ""That is the sole reason why I'm alive. I don't know how to protect  someone, but if killing him is a way to protect you, then I'd gladly end his life. That was what I  did.""",sadness
"You risked your life to find me and when I found you unconscious, for  the  first time, I felt scared.",fear
"Yes. Maybe I should've told you this before. Maybe you wouldn't get yourself involved with me  after this, and maybe your feelings toward me will disappear and turn into something else.",sadness
"As what you've heard, I am an Executioner. A member of the Jikko clan, who was exiled by the  Shou clan because of their ruthlessness. I grew up in Shima, a place where the most vicious  Erityians and humdrums are restrained, and I am one of its guardians.",sadness
W-what are we doing here?,fear
We're going to Shima. Sorry if I didn't ask your permission but I think you're safer when you're  with me.,joy
"""You're my mission,"" I said and he looked at me, surprised. ""I'd still come with you. Hideo will  scold me if I don't bring you back.""",joy
"Well, since that place has been revealed due to the jailbreakers, might as well tell you the whole  story.",sadness
" ""As I've said earlier, I'm from Jikko clan, a clan of executioners.""",sadness
"Shou didn't want to lose him so he told him that instead of killing innocent people, he should  catch the villanous ones—the embodiment of demons,",sadness
Innocent? How can you say those people are innocent when they're involved in war?,sadness
"""Politicians declare wars but they aren't the ones who suffer. It's the people. Those he killed were  refugees and soldiers who are just the victims of decisions,"" he said and I can see the distaste on  his eyes. ""I understand his reason but not his action.""",sadness
"""We should move quickly,"" sabi naman niya saka siya tumayo papunta sa motor.",fear
"Be alert. Someone's here,",fear
You can't escape it anymore.,anger
"Yeah. She has a water attribute so be careful,' he replied, still trying to avoid the maelstrom.",fear
Damn it!,anger
"""This is fun,"" the woman snickered, her hands still dipped and moving in a circular motion. ""Isn't  it, kid?""",joy
"""This is my territory, kid, and nobody is better than me in the water. Thanks to that guy, many of  us managed to escape,"" she said as the water columns grew taller.",joy
"I won't let you go any further,",anger
"Drown and maybe you can meet your grandfather in hell,",anger
"""Mitsuo!"" I yelled but he remained still. I ran to him and held his arm.",fear

"""I don't even know if I'm capable to feel that,"" he said and that made me look at him.",joy
Is it because of your clan?,sadness
"Yeah. We were raised as killing machines. I can kill someone without even blinking an eye. Do  you think someone like me, a coldblooded executioner, has the right to love someone?",sadness
I'm just curious. Why do you like me? What did I do to be worthy of your feelings?,joy
"Yeah. I still remember it,",joy
I . . . I thought your memories easily fade away?,sadness

immediately went to his office.",fear

I was just thankful that he didn't ask anything about it.,fear

"There are too many executives for you to escort and it will be too risky for you to handle them alone. Hence, this.",fear
And how does it work?,sadness
"Once you're in Shima, just press the button and the cell where the criminals are currently imprisoned will be instantly transported through shrinking and teleportation.",fear

The smile on my face faded as I marched away from the place that sheltered me since I was young.,sadness

It's time to go home.,sadness
I had lost track of time as I drifted for days in the middle of the ocean.,sadness
"Fortunately, my supplies were still enough and the ocean was calm.",joy
Nel would surely be awake by now.,fear
"I could imagine her angry face, questioning Cliff and Jett about me.",sadness
A smile escaped my lips as I reminisced the life I had in CIA.,sadness
It was never easy but it was less troubling than where I was headed.,sadness
Shima had been a subject of myths and rumors among Erityians.,sadness
"Many believed it was not real, until he met his demise.",sadness
"I could still remember that time: Executioners were ready to slaughter every Shinigami they hadimprisoned, not minding the repercussions from the administration and the
council.",anger
"Ise, then head of the Jikko clan, vowed to kill every single Shinigami who made his grandson suffer.",anger
"Naia, you should never allow anyone to read your mind,",fear
Why?,sadness
Because they can use your thoughts and memories against you.,fear
I heaved a sigh.,sadness
It's been more than a decade since he died yet the pain still lingered inside me.,sadness
I missed him.,sadness
My thoughts returned to the present when the clear sky and water suddenly turned dark.,sadness
"In a span of a few seconds, everything was already covered in fog.",fear
A wave of nostalgia hit me as I felt the fog brushed against my skin.,sadness
"""Farallon,"" I called.",fear
"As if on cue, the fog dissipated and the familiar island came into view.",joy
The silence I was enjoying a while ago was replaced by cries and screams of agony and pain.,sadness
The air was filled with metallic and putrid smell—the scent of bloodshed and death.,fear
"""Is that you, Naia?"" a voice echoed.",fear
"I smirked. ""Yeah. I thought you've already forgotten me.""",joy
A guy clad in black holding a huge scythe appeared in front of me. He still looked the same except for the additional creases on his face.,fear
"Farallon was never fazed with anything. Even when Vince brought her here, he remained inexpressive.",fear
"When Vince died, his face was expressionless but his eyes were gleaming with wrath.",sadness
Seeing him after a long time made me feel like I was a kid again.,joy
"""How's everyone?"" I asked as I came ashore.",joy
"""Why are you here?"" he questioned without answering mine.",anger
I have a special delivery,joy
"Despite his skepticism, he walked with me toward the forest.",fear
"I heard the familiar roars of Shira and Hyora, the guardians and first line of defense of this island.",joy
"""Hey,"" I snickered as the lion and leopard made their way to me.",joy
"Missed me, buddies?",joy
I didn't have any friends of my age in this place and all the Executioners were busy with their jobs and missions so I befriended these two.,sadness
"Among the natives of this island, only me and Aristus could snuggle with these deadly predators.",joy
"""Everything has changed here,"" Farallon said as we passed through the forest.",sadness
It was always dark in the woods as the canopy of trees blocked the sunlight.,sadness
I remembered getting lost here when I was young and Farallon found me in a critical state.,sadness
My arms accidentally brushed against the leaves of a poisonous plant and rendered me motionless.,sadness
The venomous insects buzzed around and the deadly plants' leaves fluttered in the wind.,fear
It took us a while to get out of the forest and the stretch of sludge came into view.,joy
"Farallon wounded himself, his blood trickling from his finger and it dropped onto the boulder at the forest's threshold.",fear
"The path of stone emerged, bridging the gap between the forest and the village.",joy
The rancid smell was enough to make someone nauseous but it was already normal for the inhabitants of this island.,fear
"When we reached the end of the path, the stones sank back into the sludge and we marched forward.",fear
"Some Executioners halted, others took a glance at me, as I walked beside Farallon.",fear
The older ones were able to recognize me as the child who had red eyes.,fear
"""Naia?"" One of the called. ""Is that you, Naia?""",joy
"""Yuma,"" I replied. ""You look old now.",sadness
He drew his sword and I swiftly fended off his attack.,fear
"Some Executioners gathered around, bellowing and cheering, as the two of us were caught in an onslaught.",anger
"He was still fast and agile despite his age. I could feel the cuts on my skin, blood streaming through my arms.",sadness
I managed to land a gash on his cheeks and he looked more excited.,anger
"""Damn, child, you better not underestimate me,"" he beamed as he charged at me.",anger
"That moment, my skin tingled as I felt an intense bloodlust from him.",fear
The unprepared are the first to die.,sadness
I remembered what I told to Jett and cursed myself for being too softhearted.,sadness
"This was Shima, a place where comrades could kill one another without giving a thought.",fear
"He disappeared from my sight, and the next thing I knew, the tip of his blade was already piercing through my right shoulder.",anger
I gritted my teeth in pain and held his sword.,anger
I kicked his neck as I my hands bled while gripping his blade.,anger
The force made him lose his balance and grip on the sword and I immediately pulled it out of my flesh.,fear
Yuma sat up and laughed hysterically as he looked at me.,anger
"""Shit, this is bad,"" he chuckled. ""I want to kill you now.""",anger
He was ready to charged at me but everyone suddenly fell silent.,fear
"I felt the immense pressure in the atmosphere, making my body tremble in fear.",fear
"""W-what was that?"" I mumbled.",fear
"Amidst the silence, I heard heavy footsteps approaching our direction",fear
The Executioners gave way and I saw a hooded man walking toward us.,fear
The tattered cloak fluttered as the wind howled.,sadness
Behind him was a woman who was eerily familiar. Then I remembered Nel's story about a Senshin who had the eyes of a Shinigami and a Custos.,fear
"The Executioners, as well as Yuma and Farallon, bowed to him and that got me confused.",sadness
"As far as I remembered, Lionel should be the de-facto leader since Ise lost his only heir when Vince died.",sadness
I was sure Lionel didn't look like that when I left Shima.,fear
"""Child, state your name,"" he demanded and I flinched upon hearing his voice.",fear
"""N-Naia,"" I answered.",fear
"""I see. The child of Diona and Heron,"" he said and my stomach churned in distress as I heard my parents' names.",anger
He carefully removed his hood and I almost got paralyzed by his stare.,fear
Intense and cold green eyes looked right into mine.,anger
"""W-who are you?"" I asked, my voice shaking in fear.",fear
He bellowed in laughter as if my question was something funny.,sadness
"""A Jikko branch clan member,"" he responded.",sadness
That old fart didn't even talk to me until he needed someone to inherit his position.,sadness
Some Executioners were visibly uncomfortable after hearing him badmouthing Ise.,fear
"I, too, felt annoyed as Ise was the most respectable person in this island.",anger
"""I vowed to hunt down every single Shinigami but they locked me up in this place,"" he seethed and I had to step back because his anger screamed danger.",anger
Damn that council of old and coward shitheads.,anger
"""Dad, calm down,"" the woman behind him softly said.",sadness
The man looked at me again after he calmed down.,joy
"""I am Kyo,"" he said, ""the strongest Executioner, and this is now my turf.""",joy
It had been three hours since I arrived in Shima yet I had already learned about what happened here after Ise and Vince died.,sadness
"Shira snuggled me and I could hear the guttural sound he was making, as if asking some attention.",fear
"""Man, you haven't change at all,"" I snickered while caressing his mane.",joy
I stayed at the shore of the island as they decide what to do with me and the prisoners I had to transfer using the Senshins and Custos technology.,fear
"Heaving a sigh, I stared at the endless sea.",sadness
I still couldn't believe that guy had been the leader the moment he arrived here. And to think that girl who had the eyes of different tribe was his daughter.,fear
I reached for my weapon as I turned my head around and saw that girl. Speaking of the devil.,fear
She walked toward my direction and Shira started snarling at her.,anger
"""Calm down, boy,"" I said.",anger
Go play with Hyora.,fear
The girl sat beside me and looked at the gray sky.,sadness
She smiled and it felt so genuine that I let my guard down for a second,joy
"You know, when I first arrived here, I thought I was going to die.",fear
"""This time, for real,"" she chuckled.",sadness
"I, too, was bringing criminals from the Nox and Sir Hideo told me that I should brace myself when I set foot here.",fear
I thought it was because of this island's reputation.,sadness
She glanced at me and her eyes were so distracting.,sadness
Her iridescent irises where beautiful and nauseating at the same time.,anger
I wonder what it felt to have eyes of different tribes and abilities.,joy
I was attacked by the Executioners the moment I landed.,sadness
"I was a fighter, too, but their strength were on a different level.",fear
It felt like I was fighting a Huntres with an instinct of a Senshin.,fear
It was terrifying.,fear
My lips curved upward. Hearing that compliment for the Jikko clan was uplifting.,joy
"My plan was to leave the criminals, deliver a news, and go back to Tantei High, but everything changed when their 'leader' came to meet me.",fear
"""It must be shocking,"" I commented.",fear
"My Dad is strong and stubborn so deep in my heart, I knew he was still alive, despite being labeled as missing in the records of the Senshins.",sadness
"The only ones we were told to be wary about in the Senshin tribe were the remnants of the Great Seven, and some of the professors.",fear
But I didn't expect to see him here. Dad never liked positions.,anger
"""Well, he's still a Jikko,"" I said. ""And when . . . when Vince died, the main family had no heir to replace him as the future leader.""",sadness
Ah. So you didn't know.,sadness
"I glanced at her, my brows furrowed, unsure if I heard that right.",sadness
Huh? What do you mean?,fear
Alternative name?,sadness
"She nodded. ""Yup. And do you know Naomi?""",sadness
Naomi?,joy
That name triggered a certain memory. I remembered the woman Vince brought here when she returned for a while. It was just a brief time but she was the first 'friend' I had.,sadness
I stifled a gasp upon hearing that. Vince and Nathalie? They . . . they had a child?,joy
"""Where are the criminals you are talking about?"" he asked, but it sounded like a demand.",anger
Maintaining my composure was difficult in front of this Kyo.,fear
His presence was enough to feel his superiority and strength.,fear
Heh. I see. That smart-ass is still developing handy inventions.,anger
Should we go to Keimusho-rei first so that they can be easily imprisoned?,sadness
"He scoffed. ""No. They need to stand trial.""",anger
There were still pools of blood on the ground and vultures were quietly looming above us.,sadness
Who's going to be tortured?,anger
"Most probably, the criminals I brought.",sadness
"The look on their faces was a mixture of nausea, confusion and anger",fear
"Despite their feet and hands being bound, few of them started attacking the people around . . . which was a wrong and dumb move.",anger
This one's mine!,anger
"Humdrums are, indeed, stupid.",anger
"Couple of Erityians, too.",anger
How does that feel?,sadness
Your members are being toyed by an 11-year old Jikko.,anger
"""A traitor like you,"" Yuma said as the tip of his scythe digging through Eerie's skin, ""brings shame to the Senshin tribe.""",anger
Yuma. Stop.,anger
"My skin crawled upon hearing that familiar voice and when I turned around, I saw Lionel walking toward our direction.",fear
"""I have finished cleaning the Rei level,"" he reported to Kyo.",joy
"""Good,"" Kyo responded and Lionel went to the Nox's direction. ""Reliable as ever,"" he commented.",joy
"""Of course,"" I said.",joy
"""You're right,"" he chuckled. ""But potential-wise, that brat is higher than him.""",anger
That brat?,anger
I shuddered when I felt his presence getting stronger and I had to step back to not get overwhelmed,fear
"When I looked at him, his grin was nowhere to be found and it was replaced with a grim expression.",sadness
"Their leader, where is he?",sadness
"""He escaped,"" I replied. ""We're currently monitoring his movements.""",sadness
I see. We can help.,joy
How?,fear
Okay. I'll be counting on you.,joy
He silently walked away and I was left alone.,sadness
I wanted to contact the CIA but communication outside was forbidden in this island.,sadness
My range had improved and I could now hear the cries and howls in the prisons.,sadness
I suddenly remembered how Nathalie almost lost her memories before because of these voices.,sadness
That must be really scary.,fear
How did you know my name?,joy
"Hearing a voice inside my head, which was neither a scream of pain nor cries from mind torture, made me flinch. Who . . . wait . . .",sadness
N-Nathalie?,fear
Who are you?,fear
"""Hey, I heard her,"" I said while catching my breath.",fear
Ah. So you knew.,joy
She's here?,joy
"Nathalie looked at my direction, a hint of surprise on her face, but after a few seconds, she smiled, as if she had finally recognized me.",joy
"""Naia?"" she called.",joy
Then my eyes drifted to the guy beside him and I halted when I saw his face.,fear
"""This pisses me off,"" Kyo grumbled",anger
"Nathalie chuckled. ""I know what you mean, Sir Kyo. Well, Hideo raised him so he kinda got his personality.""",sadness
"""You kid,"" he said while looking at the guy.",anger
"""His name is Nathan,"" Nathalie said.",fear
I don't need his real name. What's your alt—,anger
"""Hiro,"" the guy suddenly answered, cutting him off. ""Sir.""",anger
Wow. He's got guts. I'll give him that.,anger
Things to do?,anger
Kyo grinned as if he just found someone to toy with.,joy
As the rightful heir to this damned island.,sadness
Kiyoko went to the prison with Lionel to transfer the captives they just tortured.,sadness
Too much noise.,fear
"You probably should not stay here,",fear
Seems like you have the same ability as Nathalie.,sadness
What do you mean?,anger
I remembered that time Nathalie almost lost her mind.,sadness
"""You can hear inner voices despite their closed minds, right?"" He nodded.",sadness
You sure you can handle the agony and pain of the tortured?,fear
The heinous and brutal thoughts of the prisoners?,fear
The radical ways and thoughts of the executioners?,fear
He winced before he could answer my questions. I knew it. ,fear
Those voices must be causing a discomfort and pain on his mind.,fear
"""I can,"" he said.",sadness
I wasn't sure if he was confident or just foolish.,fear
"Amid the silence, I could hear faint voices, screams of agony and desperation from the prisoners.",sadness
I remembered Kyo's words a while ago and might as well use this time to see what this guy could do.,sadness
"Shock and confusion came into his face, and he leapt back, avoiding a serious cut on his neck.",fear
"Seems like your flight instincts have been honed,",joy
I remarked as blood trickled from his neck.,fear
"But, kiddo, Jikkos are known for fighting, not evading.",sadness
I guess you aren't ready to inherit that name yet.,sadness
"""Kiddo? You seem like just a few years older than me,"" he commented.",anger
"""I call everyone weaker than me a kiddo,"" I retorted, and somehow it felt good.",joy
"Before his hand could reach for something behind him, I lunged at him and gripped his arm.",anger
I felt its tip on the back of my head but he grunted and lost his balance when I headbutted him.,anger
I snatched his gun as he fell on his back and pointed it at him.,anger
"I fired two bullets on each side of his head, just a few inches from his ears.",anger
What?,anger
Did you life flash right before your eyes?,anger
"Oh, poor guy. A gun won't work against someone who lives in this island.",sadness
A smile escaped my lips as I remembered how they described Vince's death. ,sadness
They'd rather die than lose.,sadness
What are you doing?,anger
"I felt an intense pressure behind us and when I turned around, Kyo and Nathalie was already walking toward our direction.",fear
"""Just testing his skills,"" I said.",fear
Heh. And what's your assessment?,anger
"""He'd lose to Karim,"" I replied.",sadness
Too slow. Too weak. Too emotional. Too self-centered.,sadness
"If I'm an Executioner, I won't offer my trust and loyalty to someone who can't even defend himself.",sadness
"""No filters and sugarcoating, huh? I like that,"" Kyo commented.",joy
"I don't like toning down my words. A weak must know he's weak, otherwise, he'd be complacent.",fear
"""Naia . . ."" Nathalie called, a look of worry flashed on her face.",sadness
"I'm sorry, Nathalie. I'm just saying the truth.",sadness
"Well then, I need to rest.",sadness
My words might be harsh but this place is harsher.,anger
"If it was the other Executioners that challenged him, he'd be dead by now.",anger
He should have prepared himself before setting foot here.,anger
"""Aristus!"" I called as I ran toward his direction.",joy
"He smiled upon seeing me. ""Naia.""",joy
"""I just learned that you're here,"" he softly said. ""And also Nathalie . . . and his son.""",joy
I arrived yesterday and you just heard it today?,sadness
How many days did you spend inside your cave this time?,anger
"He chuckled nervously. ""Uh, a week, I think?""",fear
"""Geek,"" I muttered.",anger
"""Learning and writing our history is fun. You should try it,"" he remarked as his eyes twinkled in excitement.",joy
"Aristus is the weakest here in terms of physical abilities, but the Executioners respect his vast knowledge about our race.",joy
"""Ah. By the way, have they extracted information from the Nox members?"" I asked.",fear
"Aristus smirked and glanced at the isolated part of the island, which was called blood chamber, because of the red-dyed ground due to the volcano and keimusho.",joy
"""You know how Lionel works,"" he said.",anger
"Still as persuasive as ever, huh?",anger
Nathalie and Hiro would probably lose their minds the moment they stepped into this chamber.,sadness
How could he still look comfortable with that mantle covering his body? Damn monster.,anger
"""You sure you can handle this?"" Aristus asked.",anger
"I breathed deeply and willed myself to stay calm. ""Yeah. It's just . . . it's been a while since I last went here.""",anger
I could see that.,joy
It became hotter as we descended and it felt like my skin and bones would just melt.,fear
I could also hear the screams and cries of the prisoners and it made my head throb in pain.,sadness
Blood was splattered across his face and his blonde hair was dyed with scarlet hues.,sadness
"""Ah. I just finished questioning this one,"" he said as he lifted the guy by grabbing his hair.",anger
"""That's good,"" Aristus commented.",joy
I need more information.,anger
"""I already know where that Custos is,"" Lionel said, smirking.",joy
Ah. I wonder what kind of punishment I should give him.,anger
I shuddered upon hearing his words.,fear
"Dale was an elusive target, even for us, yet he was already thinking of how he could make his life miserable.",sadness
"""Really?"" I muttered as Farallon readied the boat",anger
"""That's the rule, kid,"" he said.",anger
You can't communicate with others within the island.,fear
"Farallon started pushing it toward the sea and before I knew it, Shima had already been shrouded in fog and mist",sadness
I was left alone in the middle of the sea and I realized there was a brewing storm nearby.,fear
"""Damn it,"" I muttered while getting the device the Commander gave me.",anger
"""Naia,"" he greeted. ""Good to hear from you.""",joy
What happened?,fear
"""The criminals have been transferred successfully, Commander,"" I reported.",sadness
"Also, one of the Executioners said he knows where Dale and Zeno are.",fear
I'd like to know the details.,anger
"Roger that, Commander.",joy
We walked back to the inland and Shira and Hyora greeted me,joy
Farallon still couldn't believe that those beasts could still remember me and I was the only one that could cuddle them.,anger
"""I heard you went to the blood chamber with Aristus,"" he said and my body almost trembled when I remembered what happened there.",anger
Yeah. It was like coming back from hell.,anger
"He snickered. ""Right. Remember when you first went there?""",joy
I remembered sneaking out from the shack to follow Vince and Lionel who were escorting the new prisoners.,sadness
"Besides, I admire both Vince and Lionel, even vowing to be their apprentice, but they both dismissed me.",sadness
"I heard voices, several of them, crying and howling in agony and pain.",sadness
It slowed me down but I thought I could control my mind.,fear
One of the prisoners they were escorting hid a knife under his footwear and pretended to tumble.,fear
"As a kid, I was beyond terrified.",fear
The prisoner took me as a hostage.,fear
I was terrified and I felt something was changing in my mind and body.,fear
Colors flickered in my irises and I saw a lot of people getting slaughtered and skinned by the knife that was poking me.,fear
Naia!,fear
Their eyes gleamed malevolently as they swung their scythes in the air.,anger
"The next thing I knew, the head of the prisoner who was holding me rolled below my dangling body, the look of terror etched on his face.",fear
"""Get her out of here,"" Lionel seethed as he looked at the rest of the prisoners who were as terrified as I was.",anger
Vince immediately carried me and I remembered crying because he got angry at me.,sadness
"I lost consciousness before we could leave the premise and the next thing I knew, I was already sleeping for two days and my eyes had changed permanently into red.",sadness
"Wow. I couldn't believe that was already a long time ago,",joy
"I said as I smiled, remembering Vince's life before he went away and died.",sadness
Yeah. And now all we have is his skinny brat.,joy
"""Can this be used in, say, a fight against a Shinigami?"" he asked but before Aristus could reply, Farallon was already charging at their direction.",fear
He tried fending off his attack but Farallon was physically stronger than him.,anger
"""Yes it can, brat,"" he said. ""this blade has been bathed by Shinigamis' blood since it was made.""",anger
"""He was trained by Ise along with Lionel and Vince. Physically, they are on par with them but he's lacking here,"" he added, pointing at his temple. ""In short, he's an idiot.""",sadness
Huh?!,anger
"Yes, that's his real attitude. He only acts quiet to look like Lionel but the truth is he's a lot more savage than Vince.",anger
"""Teach me,"" he suddenly said and that left Farallon dumbfounded.",anger
Huh?,fear
"""Teach me how to wield it effectively,"" he repeated, the blade still digging onto his neck.",anger
"""Naia,"" she called. ""Sorry if I wasn't able to talk to you.""",sadness
"""It's okay,"" I replied. ""I know you're busy.""",joy
But I'm glad I got to see you again.,joy
"Me, too.",joy
"""Send Hideo and Michiko my regards,"" Kyo told Nathalie.",joy
"She smiled. ""I will, Sir.""",joy
"""And you, boy,"" he said while looking at Hiro.",joy
"If you really want to be acknowledged by your kin, train until you wish you're dead, and maybe defeat a couple of Executioners upon your return.",fear
"""I'm already planning to . . . Sir,"" he retorted as he bowed lightly.",sadness
"You rascal, you're really his son.",anger
"""Let's go back,"" he ordered and the pressure of his presence was so heavy that I felt like my knees would buckle.",sadness
It seems like we'll get a lot of prisoners in the coming days.,fear
"That moment, I realized the Erityian race was slowly shifting . . . but I don't know if it's for the better or worse.",sadness
I couldn't sleep.,sadness
"After visiting the blood chamber, the voices I heard kept echoing inside my head.",sadness
"In addition, I could still feel the adrenaline rushing through my veins.",fear
I thought I could already control these ferocious tendencies when I lived outside this world but coming back here awakened them.,sadness
I was itching to fight someone,anger
"By nightfall, everything in the island was already engulfed in darkness.",sadness
"Curious, aren't you?",fear
"""What are you doing here?"" I asked as I pulled back my sword.",fear
"""I figure you'd be restless by now,"" she replied.",sadness
"And I don't really have any friends here. I mean, they are all so . . . extreme in a sense.",fear
So . . . what's happening?,sadness
"""After what happened to Senshins and Custos, a lot of criminals will be transferred here,"" she explained.",fear
"I see. So aside from Nox, Shinigamis will also be escorted here.",sadness
"""Yeah."" A hint of sadness flashed across her face",sadness
And you know furious they are at them.,anger
"""Because of what happened, they even harbor resentment to Hideyoshi and the administration,"" she continued.",sadness
Ise completely cut the communication between them because trusting them cost him his grandson's life.,sadness
"However, since Ise didn't know that Vince has a child, he wanted Dad to be the successor because he trusts his strength.",joy
So he's from that school?,sadness
"Yup. Apparently, he sneaked out of this island when he was a teenager because if he stayed, he'd be named as the chief of the village.",joy
What do you mean?,anger
"According to Aristus, Vince was still too young when his father died.",sadness
Ise wanted to focus on training him so he wanted to have a capable man to lead the village temporarily,sadness
"Dad, knowing his fate, left Shima to avoid that kind of responsibility.",sadness
Oh. So that's how he ended up in that school?,sadness
Yup. He was found by Hideyoshi and became his right-hand man.,joy
"I see. And after Vince died, Ise once again recommended Kyo as the chief.",joy
Yeah. The fate he wanted to avoid caught up to him. I guess he was really meant to lead this clan before the true heir steps in.,sadness
"Uhm, I just want to ask . . .",sadness
Hmm?,joy
How's Nigel?,sadness
My breath caught in my throat as I stared at her,fear
Her eyes looked at me expectantly and I felt awful after remembering his last moments.,sadness
"""I . . . I'm sorry,"" I mumbled, my voice trembling.",fear
"Her expression tightened and before I could explain anything, she had already averted my gaze.",anger
"""I see,"" she muttered vacantly.",sadness
"Kiyoko started walking away without a word. I heaved a sigh, worried about what she would do.",sadness
"Already leaving, kid?",sadness
"My body automatically reacted to his presence, jumping back and assuming a defensive stance. Kyo burst out laughing after seeing what I did.",joy
Damn it. Why was he even here?,fear
"""Yes,"" I answered. ""I'm already done with my mission.""",joy
"""Heh. I thought you'd stay,"" he remarked. ""I need strong people.""",sadness
You already have the Executioners. They are enough.,sadness
"He cackled. ""Reds are so hard to persuade.""",joy
"""Sorry, my loyalty belongs to the Custos,"" I said.",joy
"""Yeah, right,"" he retorted.",joy
"""Besides, I'm a Keeper,"" I added and smiled. ""I am needed to make sure everyone stays alive.""",joy
"Heh. For someone who grew up in a place where death is normal, your position's quite ironic.",joy
"Don't you think, kid?",sadness
"A subtle smile appeared on my lips. ""I think so, too. But I prefer this kind of life now.""",joy
"""Well, that's disappointing,"" he commented while scratching his head.",sadness
I'll take my leave then.,sadness
"""Kid! Make sure you bring the remaining traitors,"" he yelled.",anger
"Well, if the Custos can catch them.",fear
"""We will,"" I returned. ""I'm looking forward to the Shinigamis you think you can capture.""",sadness
What an arrogant brat you are.,anger
I learned that here.,joy
"""Thank you, Commander,"" Nel said.",joy
There was a few seconds of silence and it looked like they were planning something.,fear
"Huh. After our encounters with the Nox, Nel was becoming more and more like a captain.",anger
"""Contact Naia,"" she ordered after a minute of silence.",anger
Tell her to rendezvous at Romania—,anger
"""I'm listening,"" I said, my image flickering on their car's windshield.",anger
"Nel's brows furrowed. ""Where are you?""",fear
"""Leaving Shima,"" I answered.",sadness
Why do you sound exhausted? Are you okay?,sadness
I'm fine.,sadness
—in two days.,sadness
"""What? I can't,"" I said. ""It will take me weeks to—""",anger
"See you there, Naia.",fear
That freaking girl. Did she just cut me off?,anger
Damn it.,anger
I'm going to break her bones once I get there.,anger
But . . . I didn't expect I'd miss their voices that much.,sadness
It felt strange to be alone in this still and silent ocean after staying for days in Shima,sadness
"His face flickered in front of me, and even though the quality wasn't good, I could see the horror on his expression.",sadness
"""Save us,"" he pleaded.",fear
From Nel again?,anger
We're going to die.,fear
"Oh, c'mon, you cowards!",anger
"I heaved a sigh. ""Nel, stop tormenting their poor souls.""",anger
"She chuckled. ""Hey, I'm not!""",fear
"Yllka Shrine, huh?",anger
"Alright, don't worry, I'll keep you three alive.",joy
I think I'll die before we can reach Romania—,sadness
"Before I could see his expression, the line went off. I was alone again in this vast ocean.",sadness
"""Yeah, I have booked your flights,"" I said while checking the details from my other device.",joy
Be careful. There are Shinigami and Nox bases in Europe.,sadness
"""Alright,"" Nel said. ""How about you?""",sadness
"Going back to CIA, I guess.",fear
I remembered our last conversation and how he agreed to turn Midnight and Obsidian over the Jikko clan once they captured them.,anger
"""Look around,"" I ordered and from Nel's eyes, I scanned everyone from the plane.",anger
"""It's safe,"" I concluded.",joy
"""Keep the line connected,"" I said. ""I want to know everything.""",fear
"""Roger,"" Nel responded. ""Keep us alive.""",fear
Of course.,joy
"""Want me to carry you?"" Cliff asked, chuckling. ""Kiddi—!""",sadness
Hey!,joy
"""What?"" she asked, feigning innocence. ""You offered.""",fear
I didn't mean it—,sadness
"Ah, I'm tired.",sadness
"""See that yellow tree over there?"" I said, raising my voice.",fear
"""Yeah,"" Jett answered.",fear
Go to that direction.,joy
Roger.,joy
"""Something's written here,"" Jett remarked and I told Nel to look at the boulder.",fear
"""The Yllka Shrine,"" Nel noted.",joy
"""It's near,"" Cliff added.",joy
"""Should we enter this?"" asked Cliff",fear
"""Yes,"" I said. ""Look at the side of the cave.""",sadness
"Hey, you guys still okay?",sadness
"""Yeah,"" Jett responded.",joy
"It took them thirty minutes to finally find the exit, but before I could see it, the connection was cut. I couldn't hear nor see anything.",sadness
Hello? Nel? Cliff? Jett?,joy
Nothing. I tried calling them again but to no avail. They weren't responding.,sadness
I wanted to know what was going on but there were no ways to contact them anymore.,sadness
Yeah. That kid is cool.,joy
"""That guy?"" she paused.",fear
He seems responsible enough.,joy
"Oh, and despite his cold demeanor, the way he stares at people was intense. Actually, he reminds me of you.",joy
Is that so?,joy
Why are you interested in him?,fear
"I shrugged. ""Not really.""",sadness
"Honestly, I didn't expect it to be successful because of the Shinigami tribe.",sadness
"""By the way, where are you?"" Cliff asked.",fear
"I smirked. ""Had to take a detour.""",fear
"That's a secret. Oh well, talk to you guys later.",sadness
I ended the call and their faces twitch for a few seconds and finally faded.,fear
"""Agent, obliterate Nox's base in Romania,"" the voice ordered.",anger
Roger.,sadness
It felt like I was pulled back in the medieval period because of the architecture and arts around me.,joy
I caught a glimpse of a guy wearing a suit.,joy
He was a humdrum. ,sadness
He went inside the building and vanished from my sight.,sadness
"When I arrived at the central hall, I almost got decapitated.",fear
"""Who are you?"" a seven-foot tall man demanded as he swung his sword.",fear
"""A Chrome,"" one of them hissed in disgust.",fear
I wanted to do it the Keeper way but my instincts took over,sadness
"My mind was suddenly filled with angry and agonizing voices, as if I was back in Shima.",anger
"I imagined myself in the middle of the Blood Chamber, along with heinous captives.",anger
Rage and thirst filled my head,fear
"The next thing I knew, the polished floor was already flooded with blood.",sadness
His hands were trembling as he pointed his sword at my direction,fear
"Before he could take a step backward, my sword had already pierced his throat.",fear
About twenty bodies lay lifeless on the bloodied floor.,sadness
"""Hi,"" I greeted.",joy
I thought they would come at me but they stood from a distance as they continued glaring at my direction.,fear
"My blood ran cold when I saw two children, a girl and a boy and maybe about seven to ten years old, stood in front of them, their eyes vacant of feelings.",sadness
I drew a deep breath trying to calm myself but seeing those two made it difficult.,anger
"""These two weren't like those defects,"" one of the guys commented as he watched the children with an amused expression.",fear
"When I looked at the two kids, they crumbled down on their knees and collapsed.",sadness
Wha—,fear
I let my rage control me.,fear
"With my sword bathed in blood, I slashed everyone at every direction,",anger
cursing them inside my head after what they did to those children.,anger
It took me a few seconds to calm down,anger
"When I looked around, a shiver went down my spine.",anger
N-Naia . . .,sadness
Nel looked horrified as he stared at the bloodbath but her expression softened when he saw the two kids lying unconscious on the floor.,fear
"""Y-you . . ."" Cliff faltered while Jett stared curiously at me",sadness
I heaved a sigh as lifeless bodies in a pool of blood surrounded me.,sadness
"I smiled at them. ""Sorry, I can't be a good Keeper.""",sadness
"With my remaining strength, I walked at their direction. Finally, we were together again.",joy
"After what had happened in Romania, they seemed to be more nervous around me.",fear
He seemed to have control over metals but we weren't sure about its scope and limits.,fear
Hey.,joy
"Jett sat beside me as he fiddled with his old pistol, one of his favorite guns.",sadness
"I had been seeing those flashes since I first held this gun, which was several years ago already, but they still bothered me every time.",sadness
"""Are you going to retrieve this from me?"" I asked.",fear
Is it too dangerous in my hands?,fear
You look dangerous even without any weapon. Don't you know how scary you are?,sadness
Those three feared me for reasons I couldn't understand but he was brave enough to sit with me after what I did in Romania.,fear
"""So, you're not for this,"" I noted.",sadness
His expression darkened.,anger
I could feel the tension on his shoulders as he continued playing with his pistol.,anger
"""Was that your true ability?"" he asked",fear
You can fight in the frontline with that kind of swordsmanship.,anger
"""Aren't you terrified after seeing that?"" I returned.",fear
And how about you two?,sadness
"""Well, of course!"" Nel cried",joy
"Even though I already saw a glimpse of your feral nature before, this one was on another level.",joy
"""I think you're stronger than Nel,"" Cliff remarked which earned him a punch from Nel.",anger
"Why did you even become a Keeper?"" Jett added. ""You belong in the frontline.",sadness
I heaved a sigh and smiled,sadness
"I was a wild kid back then. You know, when I arrived in our headquarters, the first thing I did was pick a fight with the Commander.",sadness
You what?!,anger
"Well, I was raised . . . differently, so I didn't know how to act in front of people. Commander—!",sadness
I couldn't continue what I was going to say because of the sudden turbulence.,fear
"""Da—Commander,"" Nel greeted.",fear
"""Team Optimus, well done,"" he said, ""but I have another mission for you and this takes priority.""",joy
The Executives have apprehended Dale and Zeno in France but their vehicle was damaged beyond repair.,sadness
"The four of us exchanged looks and nodded. ""Roger!""",joy
Very well. ,joy
I expect your return in a few days.,joy
His face flickered and disappeared after sending the message.,joy
"""There,"" Cliff said while looking at the port.",joy
'Is that their vehicle?' I asked.,sadness
"'I don't think so,' Jett replied.",fear
They said it was destroyed. Maybe they just borrowed it from a humdrum and marked it so we would know how to find them.,fear
Right.,fear
"""She said you don't need to keep a distance anymore,"" Nel said from my earpiece.",fear
Jett and I exchanged nervous looks,fear
"As Keeper and Specialist, we were used to keep an eye on things from afar until we were required to close the gap.",sadness
My mouth hung open when I saw two figures scrunched down the floor,fear
"Zeno and Dale were bloodied, just like the rest of the Executives.",sadness
Von had visible gunshots on his shoulders and leg but he didn't seem to mind them.,sadness
Fenn had it worse. ,sadness
 He had deep cuts on his hands and a long gash from his right to left cheek,sadness
"""What are those?"" Nel pointed at the headgears wore by Dale and Zeno.",anger
"""Oh, those would keep them unconscious,"" Von answered.",fear
Tranquilizers don't work on them.,sadness
"The gear slows down the brainwaves, much slower than the delta waves, so they appear to be in the state between sleep and death.",sadness
"""It's still in the middle of testing,"" Yue added, ""but we had no choice.""",sadness
Dale could turn invisible for a few seconds and Zeno could paralyze the nerves of a person using his blood.,sadness
"""This marks the end of Nox,"" Von said as he looked at Dale with a pained expression.",sadness
"""Let's go home,"" Yue said.",joy
Nox has created hatred toward humdrums and vilified their existence.,anger
"I know many of you believe this, too.",sadness
He knew his silence would just bring more harm to the tribe.,fear
"And maybe that's one of the reasons why our fellow agents fell into the wrong side,",sadness
"Our progenitor, Lord Edda, established the Custos tribe to be the guardian and protector of the people.",joy
"After his speech, he informed them the Executives were currently resting due to the injuries they got.",sadness
"For the first time in a long time, I relaxed my mind after putting up walls to protect my thoughts.",joy
"""Your Dad really has a way with words,"" I said as I stared at the ceiling.",sadness
"Nel snickered. ""Yeah. And he's got charisma.""",joy
Pressured?,fear
"""A lot. Why can't he be a normal leader?"" she grumbled.",anger
Silence filled the room. She must be also exhausted after our mission.,sadness
"""Sleep well,"" I muttered, and I also slumbered.",sadness
I sat up groggily and pulled my device from my pocket and there was a message from the Commander.,sadness
"""Commander,"" I greeted.",fear
"""I assume you already know why you're here,"" he said",anger
"With what had transpired before the capture of Dale and Zeno, I already had an idea about what he wanted me to do. My expression hardened",sadness
"""Yes, Sir,"" I answered.",sadness
He looked at me with his intense red eyes and it felt like seeing the Blood Chamber from them.,anger
"Just like what you did before, these cells would be transported using a remote device.",sadness
Commander's face darkened.,anger
The cells will disintegrate once it gets teleported.,anger
"""Yes,"" I lied.",fear
"""Where are you going?"" I asked.",anger
I thought we have a mission?,sadness
Mission?,anger
"My mind was buzzing with questions, but I didn't know what to ask first, until Cliff talked to me.",fear
"Naia, would it be better if we go now? And how many days would we travel in the ocean?",fear
What the heck are you talking about?,anger
"""This is already slow,"" Nel retorted.",anger
"If I were on my right mind, I would have laughed, but Nel's speed was just making me more distressed.",sadness
"""We're going to die,"" Jett muttered shakily, his face already pale with terror.",anger
Nel sped up and both of them cursed as they cried for their lives.,joy
Are you sure about this?,sadness
"""I'm curious about your previous life,"" she said.",fear
"You know, we've been teammates for so long yet I only know a few things about you.",sadness
"""My life's not that interesting,"" I retorted",sadness
"""It is,"" Jett chimed in",joy
Yeah.,joy
"""You'll know soon,"" I muttered, hoping they would lose interest sooner or later.",fear
"""How long until we reach the island?"" Jett asked.",sadness
"I shrugged. ""It depends. Since the weather's quite good, I guess around three to four days. Or maybe a week.""",sadness
What?,anger
"""So what will we do now?"" Cliff asked.",fear
"""Nothing,"" I answered.",sadness
Nothing?,anger
Yes. Nothing. We'll just wait until the gatekeeper finds us.,sadness
"When I traveled here few weeks ago, I felt alone and restless, not knowing how long I would drift in the middle of nowhere.",sadness
I smiled at them and stole a snack from Jett's supplies.,joy
"""You guys should sleep,"" I said. ""I'll take first watch.""",sadness
She lay down beside me and heaved a deep sigh.,sadness
"Mentally draining, isn't it?",fear
I can't even imagine how I'm going to survive if I'm alone. ,fear
How do you even do it?,anger
"I shrugged. ""I'm used to it.""",anger
"Each of them assumed a defensive stance, their weapons ready.",sadness
"""W-what's happening?"" she asked.",sadness
"I stood at the front of the raft. ""We're here.""",joy
Sorry.,sadness
I'm the only one who can go inside.,sadness
But—,sadness
"""It's okay,"" I said, reassuring them. ""Just wait for me here.""",sadness
"""How long should we wait?"" asked Cliff",anger
Until I return. Don't do anything. Don't look for me. Just stay here and wait.,anger
And if we do something?,anger
"I stared at Jett and smirked. ""You'd be dead before you can do anything.""",anger
"""Why are you here again?"" asked Farallon who seemed displeased with my presence.",anger
"""I have a delivery,"" I retorted. ""Kind of grand prize material.""",joy
"""You want me to ride you?"" I asked and she purred in response.",anger
Why are they only friendly to you?,anger
"I chuckled. ""Jealous?""",fear
"Shut your mouth, Naia.",anger
Oops. Sorry.,fear
"""Why are you here, kid?"" he asked in a disgruntled tone",sadness
I had to choke back the creeping fear on my throat.,fear
He drew a deep breath and cracked his neck.,fear
"""Commander Priam acts fast,"" he remarked. ""I didn't expect that.""",sadness
"Well, he wants to end this Nox problem as quick as possible.",anger
I still wasn't sure why he looked irritated but I managed to tell him the details of the transport,fear
"""I'll let my best fighters handle them,"" he said.",joy
Two figures appeared; their headgears already destroyed.,sadness
"Welcome to my island, traitors.",anger
I didn't know you're here again.,fear
"""You know, you almost lost your head,"" I said as I got my hands off the sheath",fear
"He sighed and adjusted his glasses. ""I won't be surprised. Everyone seems to be itching to kill somebody.""",sadness
"Speaking of that, why is everyone acting weird?",fear
Wait—!,fear
The Shinigami felt my presence and drew a dagger.,anger
"We exchanged blows, trying to outmaneuver each other, but despite using a shorter blade, he was keeping up with my attacks and speed.",anger
"""Who are you?"" I grumbled, ""and why are you here?""",anger
"""You're a Custos,"" he said. ""Why—""",anger
"""I'm the one asking questions,"" I retorted. ""You have no right—""",anger
"My knees buckled, as if my strength were being sucked out. ",fear
Orbs danced before my eyes as I blinked hard.,fear
Did he use his sixth sense?,fear
Stop. Both of you.,anger
"""H-he's a Shinigami . . ."" I muttered, still disoriented from that strange attack.",sadness
"""I know,"" she said.",anger
Then why . . .,anger
"""I'm Darwin,"" he greeted with a calm expression",joy
I'm here as the representative of the revolutionary faction of the Shinigami tribe.,joy
"""You're the one who sent a message to Nel,"" I mentioned.",sadness
The one she met in Romania?,anger
"""Why is he here?"" I asked.",fear
"""He's looking for someone,"" answered Kiyoko.",fear
That's why everyone is agitated.,fear
"""Sorry for the distress I caused,"" he told Kiyoko.",sadness
"She smiled. ""It's alright.""",joy
"He, too, smiled upon hearing that. ""I'm glad to hear that.""",joy
But it seems like the person I'm searching for isn't here. I need to go now.,sadness
"""Who's the person you are looking for?"" I chimed in.",sadness
They exchanged looks and he flashed a subtle smile.,joy
Someone who can turn the tide in the fight between the Shinigami factions.,fear
"""Aristus will escort you to the shore,"" she said.",joy
"Darwin bowed at her. ""Thank you.""",joy
"""I know you're mad,"" said Kiyoko who was looking at the same direction.",sadness
"I, too, despise the Shinigamis with all my heart.",sadness
"But you know, maybe this time, the Shinigamis can finally redeem their tribe's honor.",sadness
Her youthful appearance made me forget that she was older than what she looked like.,sadness
I heaved a sigh. Maybe it would be okay to trust her words.,fear
"""By the way, where is Kyo?"" I asked.",fear
"Oh, he must be questioning the Reapers Darwin just brought in exchange of his search.",joy
"Well, I guess I don't need to tell him I'm leaving.",sadness
"She chuckled softly. ""I will tell him. Good work on bringing the criminals here. Goodbye, Naia.""",joy
Yeah. Goodbye—,sadness
"Oh, wait.",fear
She smiled at me but her eyes showed concern.,joy
Dad said you probably want this.,joy
My heart almost sank when I realized what it was,fear
My hands started trembling and it felt like I was a child again.,fear
"""This was the spear that killed him,"" she confirmed.",sadness
"The Senshins gave it to Ise as a reminder that he died as a hero, but he just tossed it in the armory.",sadness
I winced upon hearing her story and remembered how it happened.,sadness
"The moment my finger touched its blade, a flash of memories flooded my mind",sadness
A girl whose green eyes were seething with hatred . . .,anger
"""Are you okay?"" Kiyoko asked with a worried tone.",sadness
"""Y-yes,"" I weakly said. ""I'm . . . I'm okay. Thank you for this.""",joy
"""Naia,"" she called. ""Say hello to Nel for me.""",joy
I will.,joy
Do you know how difficult it is to keep these two from entering the island?,fear
"""What?"" I asked",anger
What's wrong with them?,anger
They're just worried about you. You spent almost three hours there.,sadness
Heh. When did you guys become so clingy?,anger
"""I am not clingy,"" Nel retorted. ""It's just that this place is giving me the creeps.""",fear
"""She's right,"" Jett added.",sadness
"I already told you that this place isn't normal. Oh well, we're leaving.",fear
"""I'm glad you're safe,"" Nel suddenly said, breaking the silence.",joy
I . . . I really thought you're not coming back to us.,sadness
"I looked at her, but she kept her gaze in front of her",sadness
"A smile escaped my lips. ""I'm a Keeper,"" I said. ""I need to stay alive and safe to keep my team from dying.""",joy
"""Whoa, careful!"" Cliff cried as he tried to balance the raft.",fear
"""Nel, you're crushing her,"" Jett commented.",fear
"""Yeah. You're a Keeper so please don't do anything dangerous, or else, we'll die,"" she muttered, ignoring the guys' comments.",fear
"I chuckled and patted her back. ""Roger, Captain.""",joy
The smile didn't leave my face as we drifted farther away from the place that I once called home,joy
We're going home.,joy
Cries of terror and anguish.,sadness
Weapons clashing against each other,anger
"Naomi's thoughts flooded my mind as Mitsuo collapsed on his knees, refusing to slump on the ground even on his final breath",sadness
My heart sank upon seeing two of my friends in the brink of their death.,sadness
Rielle's wishes broke my heart. Paano pa kaya si Hideo?,sadness
'Ah . . . I think it's time . . .' she muttered.,fear
"Mitsuo coughed blood but he remained looking in the sky, the rain falling down his face.",sadness
His eyes were already closed but I could still hear his faint voice in my head.,fear

My voice faltered and tears started streaming down my face,sadness
You will stay alive in our memories. You can rest now.,sadness

The Council will surely question their ties and loyalty.,fear
"Sana nga, panaginip lang ang lahat.",sadness
"""Rielle Miyamoto. Vince Alejandrino,"" Hideo said. ""Remember their names.""",sadness

My feet steered me to a familiar place and the tears I was holding back streamed silently down my face.,sadness
"If the council won't allow her to live inside the campus, she can have my cabin in the forest. Pwede mo siyang dalawin doon.",fear
My knees buckled as the sword I was gripping tightly dropped on the ground.,sadness

I wasn't strong enough to accept their death.,fear
I wasn't strong enough to keep my tears from falling.,sadness
Hindi ko kayang manatili sa tabi nila gaya ni Akira dahil ayaw kong tanggapin na wala na sila.,sadness
I didn't want to see their lifeless bodies.,sadness
Hindi ko alam kung ilang oras akong nakaupo lang doon habang patuloy na umiiyak.,sadness
It was hard to tell the time because of the thick canopies of trees blocking the sky,sadness
"It was hard to stay focused when, at the back of my mind, I was still thinking about Akemi and Mitsuo.",sadness
Isang malalim na buntong-hininga ang pinakawalan ko. I relaxed my body and started walking toward the cabin when I felt that sinister air again,sadness
"My instincts and rage took over. I summoned a spear, and along with my sword, I swung both weapons at their direction.",anger

I pulled my weapons out of their bodies and their blood splattered onto my face and clothes.,anger

"Kahit na alam kong hindi na maibabalik pa ang buhay nila, sa ganitong paraan ko lang sila maipaghihiganti.",anger
